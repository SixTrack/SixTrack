Test the wire elements  with ibeco=1 in the beam block.

--- Input files:
fort.2 - SixTrack input for the LHC of 2016 without Beam - beam interactions at IPs

Additional elements installed for the test:
wire_1
wire_2
Beam-Beam element 
wire_3
wire_4
wire_5

--- Tests:
1. Test subtraction of closed orbit (flagco):
kick from wire_1 (positive current, closed orbit subtracted manually from wire's displacement) should be compensated by
kick from wire_2 (negative current, closed orbit subtracted automatically from the wire's separations)

2. Test that Beam-Beam lens compensates the wire:
Beam-Beam element has approximately the same strength (but the opposite sign) with wire_3

3. Test the tilt of the wire:
wires 4 and 5 with opposite strengths and tilts compensate each other.
