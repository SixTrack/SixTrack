Tests:
- thin4d and thin6d use the same single and structure elements. Test based on LHC lattice with ELEN inserted at IP4.
- thck4d adds an element 'thicky' with a nonzero length to force the thick 4D tracking to the thin4d/thin6d test.
- thck6d is based on thick6dblocks as the LHC example could not be used as for 6D thick tracking linear elements can not be grouped in blocks -> LHC example as defined fails.

Python script:
The python script elens_plot_kick.py plots the kick received from the elens. In total 4 elenses are inserted to check 4 different cases:
1) hel1: no offset
2) hel2: offset x, offset y
3) hel3: offset x, no offset y
4) hel4: no offset x, offset y
The particle coordinates are dumped before and after the 4 elenses in the files HEL_DUMP_*. The kick given by the elens is then just the difference between the particle coordinates after and before the elens.

For the case 'UNIFORM' the elens should only x',y'. The script checks that x,y are unchanged (rrin-rrout=0) and then plots the difference in (x'**2+y'**2). The maximum kick given should be theta_r2 indicated by a black line. As the offset is subtracted from x,y, the kick needs to look the same for all 4 cases (see kick.png).
