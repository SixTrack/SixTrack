Tests of the wire elements.
fort.2 - SixTrack input for the LHC of 2016 without Beam - beam interactions at IPs

Additional elements for the test:
wire_1
wire_2
Beam-Beam element 
wire_3
wire_4
wire_5
------------------------------------------

1. Close orbit automatic subtraction test:
kick from wire_1 (positive current, closed orbit subtracted manually from wire's displacement) should be compensated by
kick from wire_2 (negative current, closed orbit subtracted automatically from the wire's separations)

2. Beam lens compensation:
Beam-Beam element has approximately the same strength (but the opposite sign) with wire_3

3. Tilted wire:
wires 4 and 5 with opposite strengths and tilts compensate each other.
