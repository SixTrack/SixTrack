Tests:
- thin4d and thin6d use the same single and structure elements. Test based on LHC lattice with ELEN inserted at IP4.
- thck4d adds an element 'thicky' with a nonzero length to force the thick 4D tracking to the thin4d/thin6d test.
- thck6d is based on thick6dblocks as the LHC example could not be used as for 6D thick tracking linear elements can not be grouped in blocks -> LHC example as defined fails.
- thin6d_DYNK is like thin6d but the four elenses are assigned time-varying kicks - switch off, pulsing, random on/off, random kick amplitude;
- thin6d_DYNK_ZIPF is identical to thin6d_DYNK, but checks also the ZIPF functionality on the HEL_DUMP_* files (see later);
- thin6d_ions is like thin6d but the machine is set for Xe-129 and 7*4 ion species are tracked (see initial.dat); moreover, the simulation starts at IP4.
- thin6d_ramp_DYNK is like thin6d but the energy is ramped (0.5MeV/turn, 100k turns) and two elenses are assigned time-varying kicks (pulsing) whereas the other two are kept on

Python script:
The python script elens_plot_kick.py plots the kick received from the elens. In total 4 elenses are inserted to check 4 different cases:
1) hel1: no offset, UNIFORM e-beam
2) hel2: offset x, offset y, radial e-beam profile as from .txt file, theta_R2 re-calculated
3) hel3: offset x, no offset y, GAUSSIAN e-beam
4) hel4: no offset x, offset y, GAUSSIAN e-beam, theta_R2 re-calculated
The particle coordinates are dumped before and after the 4 elenses in the files HEL_DUMP_*. 3 sets are dumped and processed (beginning/middle/end of simulation):
- first 2k turns;
- turns from 50001 to 52000;
- turns from 95001 to 97000;
The kick given by the elens is then just the difference between the particle coordinates after and before the elens. Various R1 and R2 are set. For further infos, please see fort.3

The script checks that x,y are unchanged (rrin-rrout=0) and then plots the difference in (x'**2+y'**2). The maximum kick given should be theta_r2 indicated by a black line. As the offset is subtracted from x,y, the kick needs to look the same for all 4 cases (see kick.png) - apart from R1 and R2, and shapes. In the case of the ions test, colors identify the different ion species.
