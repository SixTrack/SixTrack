Tests:
- tests (thin6d/thin4d) based on HL-LHC v1p4 lattice;
- optics: IR1/5 beta*=15cm, flat machine;
- machine set for Pb ions, 7 Z TeV;
- lattice starts at IR4 CAV, where DX=0;

Test tracks 24 particles for 4k turns:
- 8 species: proton, C-12, Fe-56, Xe-129, Tl-208, Pb-207, Pb-208;
- for each species, 4 starting conditions:
  - 2 on-momentum, with ~0 and ~6sig (30degs on xy-plane) amplitude;
  - 2 off-momentum, with same starting conditions (betatron) and -2*sigdpp/Z (sigdpp/Z=1.1E-4);

Checks:
- all particles are dumped at the first turn at every element;
- all particles are dumped at the first element at every turn;
The python script shows the output of the two dumps and some infos on the ion species:
