Tests:
- thin6d is very similar to that of the elens. Test based on LHC lattice with CHEBY inserted at IP4.
- thin6d_DYNK is like thin6d but the four lenses are assigned time-varying kicks - switch off, pulsing, random on/off, random kick amplitude;
- thin6d_ramp_DYNK is like thin6d_DYNK but three (out of four) lenses are assigned time-varying kicks during a ramp;

Python script:
The python script cheby_plot_kick.py plots the kick received from the chebyshev leses. In total 4 lenses are inserted to check 4 different cases:
1) cheby1: uses the map in cheby.dat as is
2) cheby2: as cheby1 with offset of (-2, 2) mm (x,y)
3) cheby3: as cheby1 with offset of ( 2,-2) mm (x,y), rotated by -90 degs
4) cheby4: as cheby1 rotated by 135 degs
The particle coordinates are dumped before and after the 4 lenses in the files CHEBY_DUMP_*. The kick given by the lens is then just the difference between the particle coordinates after and before the elens. Various R1 and R2 are set. For further infos, please see fort.3

The script checks that x,y are unchanged (rrin-rrout=0) and then plots the difference in (x',y'). Offsets and tilt angle should be visible in maps. The script also checks that points outside the domain of the lenses are not assigned a kick, and points inside the domain are always assigned a kick.

For the DYNK tests, the script makes also a plot of the kicks along a given theta in the map ref frame. The four sets of plots should be identical, apart from the time dependence.

The test also dumps the potential map of each lens - a python script is available to plot and check all of them
