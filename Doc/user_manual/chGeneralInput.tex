\section{Program Version} \label{ProVer}

The \textit{Program Version} input block determines if all of the input will be in the input file \texttt{fort.3}, or if the geometry part of the machine (see~\ref{MaGe}) will be in a separate file: \texttt{fort.2}.
The latter option is useful if tracking parameters are changed, but the geometry part of the input is left as it is.
The geometry part can be produced directly from a MAD-X input file (see~\ref{MADT}).

\bigskip
\begin{tabular}{@{}lp{0.8\linewidth}}
    \textbf{Keyword}    & \texttt{FREE} or \texttt{GEOM} \\
    \textbf{Data lines} & None \\
    \textbf{Format}     & \texttt{keyword comment title} \\
\end{tabular}

\paragraph{Format Description}~

\bigskip
\begin{tabular}{@{}lp{0.8\linewidth}}
    \texttt{keyword} & The first four characters of the first line of the \texttt{fort.3} input file are reserved for the keyword. \texttt{FREE} for free format input with all input in \texttt{fort.3}, and \texttt{GEOM} if the geometry part is in file  \texttt{fort.2}. \\
    \texttt{comment} & Following the first four characters, 8 characters are reserved for comments \\
    \texttt{title}   & The next 60 characters are interpreted as the title of the output file \texttt{fort.6}.
\end{tabular}

% ================================================================================================================================ %
\section{Print Selection} \label{PriSel}

Use of the \textit{Print Selection} input block causes the printing of the input data to the output file \texttt{fort.6}.
It is advisable to always use this input block to have a complete protocol of the tracking run.

\bigskip
\begin{tabular}{@{}lp{0.8\linewidth}}
    \textbf{Keyword}    & \texttt{PRIN} \\
    \textbf{Data lines} & None
\end{tabular}

% ================================================================================================================================ %
\section{Comment Line} \label{ComLin}

An additional comment can be specified with the \textit{Comment} block.
The comment will be written to the binary data files (Appendix~\ref{Header}), and will appear in the post processing output as well.

\bigskip
\begin{tabular}{@{}lp{0.8\linewidth}}
    \textbf{Keyword}    & \texttt{COMM} \\
    \textbf{Data lines} & 1 \\
    \textbf{Format}     & A string of up to 80 characters.
\end{tabular}

% ================================================================================================================================ %
\section{Iteration Errors} \label{IteErr}

For the processing procedures, the number of iterations and the precision to which the processing is to be performed are chosen with the \textit{Iteration Errors} input block.
If the input block is left out, default values will be used.

\bigskip
\begin{tabular}{@{}lp{0.8\linewidth}}
    \textbf{Keyword}    & \texttt{ITER} \\
    \textbf{Data lines} & 1 to 4 \\
    \textbf{Format}     & Each data line holds three values as in table~\ref{T-IteErr}, except for the fourth line where the horizontal and vertical aperture limits can be additionally specified. This has been added to avoid artificial crashes for special machines.

\section{MAD-X to SixTrack Conversion} \label{MADT}

A converter has been developed~\cite{CONVERTOR}, which is directly linked to MAD-X\@.
It produces the geometry file \texttt{fort.2}; an appendix to the parameter file \texttt{fort.3}, which defines which of the multipole errors are switched on; the error file \texttt{fort.16}, and the file \texttt{fort.8} which holds the transverse misalignments and the tilt of the non-linear kick elements.
It also produce a file \texttt{fort.34} with linear lattice functions, phase advances and multipole strengths needed for resonance calculations for the program \textit{SODD}~\cite{SODD}.

% A description of %how to use the converter can be found in Appendix\ref{MADSIXC}.
% Pasted here for reference:

% \chapter{MAD SixTrack Convertor} \label{MADSIXC}

% A special version of the MAD program has been generated that creates
% input files for SixTrack with the complete and exact description of
% the current accelerator model stored in MAD\@. This then allows a
% detailed comparison of the tracking results from both programs.

% The programs SixTrack and MAD \cite {MAD} are both used for particle
% tracking in realistic machines such as the LHC with all expected field
% errors up to the highest order, and with displacement errors of
% quadrupoles and possibly other elements. The LHC lattice and error
% description, however, exists only in MAD format due to its much
% greater flexibility and readability. If one wants to compare tracking
% results of the two programs one needs therefore a conversion of the
% current machine inside MAD into SixTrack format. In particular the
% generated random field and displacement errors have to be transmitted
% correctly since they influence the outcome of the long-term tracking
% greatly.

% To this end it was necessary to make a special MAD version that reads
% a machine description, expands it, generates the errors, and then
% performs the necessary transformations for SixTrack: different
% conventions for the signs of magnet forces, grouping of identical
% elements, concatenation of multiple drift spaces, creation of blocks
% of linear elements between nonlinear ones, a different description
% of field and position errors, and similar tedious questions had to be
% solved. The results of the transformation are then written into input
% files for SixTrack.

% The special MAD version is actually a full MAD (except for plotting)
% with an additional module for the SixTrack output.  This then allows
% the user to perform orbit corrections and other calculations inside
% MAD, and have the resulting modifications of the machine be
% transferred to SixTrack.  All position errors (including tilt errors)
% and field errors are transmitted.

% The converter works correctly for thin and thick lens lattices.  In
% the latter case, all dipoles and quadrupoles are split into two, and a
% multipole is inserted in the centre, except for orbit corrector
% magnets which are converted to thin lens.  Since MAD does not support
% field errors higher than third order for thick elements, the
% multipolar errors will have to be created with the corresponding thin
% lens model, or by some other means.

% The special MAD version accepts one additional command:
% \begin{verbatim}
%  sixt:
%       elem       = (up to 20) element names
%       lgelem     = (up to 20) lengths of the above elements
%       structure  = structure file name, default: "fort.2"
%       param_in   = name of a (mandatory, possibly empty)
%                    extra input file for MAD, default: "fort.3.in"
%       param_out  = parameter file name, default: "fort.3"
%       errors     = field errors file name, default: "fort.16"
%       poserr     = position errors file name, default: "fort.8"
%       cavall     = all cavities in the structure, default: one only.
% \end{verbatim}
% The element length facility is necessary to give SixTrack the real
% lengths of the dipoles (and possibly other elements) that are replaced
% by thin multipoles.  \\
% The parameter input file is copied to the start of the parameter
% output file which may be useful in certain situations.
