\chapter*{Acknowledgement}

I would like to thank my colleagues at DESY and CERN to help to find nasty bugs and for a thorough check of the program.
I would like to thank Mikko Vaenttinen who helped to vectorise the program.
He also did most of the typing of the manuscript.
Moreover, I want to express my gratitude to F.~Zimmermann who helped to finish the differential--algebra part in endless night sessions.
Additions concerning Normal Forms have been contributed by M.~Giovannozzi.
J.~Miles helped with the calculation of the 6D Courant--Snyder matrix and its use to transform the tracking data in the post--processing.
W.~Herr is thanked for providing a software package used for the orbit correction. L.H.A.~Leunissen extracted and adapted the 6D beam--beam code of Hirata~\cite{Hirata}.
