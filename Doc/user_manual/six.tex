  {\bf Abstract} \\
\end{center}
The aim of SixTrack is to track two nearby particles taking into
account the full six--dimensional phase space including synchrotron
oscillations in a symplectic manner. It allows to predict the
long--term dynamic aperture which is defined as the border between
regular and chaotic motion. This border can be found by studying the
evolution of the distance in phase space of two initially nearby
particles.  Parameters of interest like nonlinear detuning and smear
are determined via a post--processing of the tracking data.  An
analysis of the first order resonances can be done and correction
schemes for several of those resonances can be calculated.  Moreover
there is the feature to calculate a one--turn map to very high order
and the full six--dimensional case, using the LBL differential
algebra. This map allows a subsequent theoretical 
analysis like normal form procedures which are provided by \'{E}.
Forest~\cite{DALIE}.

The linear elements are usually treated as thick elements in
SixTrack\@.  In that case there is at least one non--zero length
element in the structure file which is not a drift--element.  If the
accelerator, however, is modelled exclusively with drifts and kicks
SixTrack automatically uses the thin--lens formalism according to
G.~Ripken \cite{Ripken95}. A common header of output
data and the format of these data has been found for MAD and SixTrack
tracking data.

\chapter{Introduction}

The Single Particle Tracking Code SixTrack is optimised to carry two
particles~\footnote{Two particles are needed for the detection of
  chaotic behaviour.}  through an accelerator structure over a large
number of turns. It is an offspring of RACETRACK \cite{RACETRACK}
written by Albin Wrulich and its input structure has been changed as
little as possible so that slightly modified RACETRACK input files or
those of other offsprings like FASTRAC \cite{FASTRAC} can be read in.

The main features of SixTrack are: \bigskip
\begin{enumerate}
\item Treatment of the full six--dimensional motion including
  synchrotron motion in a symplectic manner \cite{Ripken85}.  The
  energy can be ramped at the same time considering the relativistic
  change of the velocity \cite{Ripken87}.
\item Detection of the onset of chaotic motion and thereby the
  long--term dynamic aperture by evaluating the Lyapunov exponent.
\item Post--processing procedure allowing
 \begin{itemize}
 \item calculation of the Lyapunov exponent
 \item calculation of the average phase advance per turn
 \item FFT analysis
 \item resonance analysis
 \item calculation of the average, maximum and minimum values of the
   Courant--Snyder emittance and the invariants of linearly coupled
   motion
 \item calculation of smear
 \item plotting using the CERN packages HBOOK, HPLOT and HIGZ
   \cite{HBOOK,HPLOT,HIGZ}
 \end{itemize}
\item Calculation of first--order resonances and of correction schemes
  for the resonances \cite{Gilbert78}.
\item Calculation of the one--turn map using the differential algebra
  techniques. The original DA package by M.Berz \cite{Berz89} has been
  replaced by the package of LBL~\cite{DALIE}. The Fortran code is
  transfered into a Map producing via the (slightly modified) ``DAFOR''
  code~\cite{DAFOR}.
\item The code is vectorised, with two particles, the
  number of amplitudes, the different relative momentum deviations
  \mbox{$ \frac{\Delta p}{p_o} $} in parallel
  \cite{Sixvec}.
\item Operational improvements:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item free format input
 \item optimisation of the calculation of multipole kicks
 \item improved treatment of random errors
 \item each binary data--file has a header describing the history of
   the run (Appendix~\ref{Header})
 \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

The SixTrack input is line oriented. Each line of 80 characters is
treated as one string of input in which a certain sequence of numbers
and character strings is expected to be found.  The numbers and
character strings must be separated by at least one blank, floating
point numbers can be given in any format, but must be distinguished
from integer numbers. Omitted values at the end of an input line will
keep their default values (~\ref{DTP}), and lines with a slash ``/'' in
the first column will be ignored by the program.

For detailed questions concerning rounding errors, calculation of the
Lyapunov exponent and determination of the long--term dynamic
aperture, see \cite{thesis}.

In chapter~\ref{InpStr}, the input structure of SixTrack is discussed
in detail.  To facilitate the use of the program, a set of appendices
are added, giving a list of keywords \mbox{(Appendix~\ref{Lkey}),} a
list of default values \mbox{(Appendix~\ref{Default}),} the input and
output files \mbox{(Appendix~\ref{Files}),} a description of the data
structure of the binary data--files \mbox{(Appendix~\ref{Header})} and
tracking examples \mbox{(Appendix~\ref{Exam}).}

\chapter{Versions and Service}

There are two versions: for element by element tracking there
is a vector version, and there is a version to produce a
one--turn map using the LBL Differential Algebra package. In both
cases the input structure file \# 2 is used to determine if the thick
or thin linear element mode has to be used.

To use the power of the Differential Algebra, for instance to
calculate the 6--D closed orbit in an elegant fashion, the tracking
versions may also be equipped with a low order map facility to avoid
the otherwise huge demand on memory. 

It must be mentioned that in the linear thin--lens version dipoles
have to be treated in a special way. See section~\ref{MulBlo} for
details.

To convert MAD files into SixTrack input a special conversion program
$mad\_6t$~\cite{CONVERTOR} has been developed (see also~\ref{MADT}).

The following subroutines are taken from various packages:

\subsection{Evolution of SixTrack}
Lastly, I would like to give a short historical overview how the versions of SixTrack have evolved.
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Version 1}

  The first version has been an upgrade of RACETRACK~\cite{RACETRACK}
  to include the full 6D formalism for long linear elements by
  G.~Ripken~\cite{Ripken85}.
\item {\bf Version 2}

  The DA--package and the Normal Form
  techniques~\cite{Berz89,Forest89} have been added to allow the
  production of high--order one--turn Taylor maps and their
  analysis. The 6D thin--lens formalism~\cite{Ripken95} has also been
  included to speed--up the tracking without appreciable deterioration
  of the accelerator model for very large Hadron colliders like the
  LHC.
\item {\bf Version 3}
  
  For the present version the beam--beam kick \`a la Bassetti and
  Erskine~\cite{BasErs} has been included together with the 6D part by
  Hirata et al.~\cite{Hirata}. Moreover, this 6D part has been
  upgraded to include the full 6D linear coupling~\cite{ripbeam}.
  Lastly, the LBL DA--package has replaced the original one by Berz
  and all operations, needed to set--up the accelerator structure, are
  now performed with the help of Forest's LieLib package~\cite{DALIE}.
\item {\bf Version 4 -- in preparation}
  
  Upgrading the program to FORTRAN90. This is of interest in
  particular as \'E.~Forest has wrapped his tools in this more
  powerful language. Using operator overloading it will be possible to
  perform the map production with a code which is almost identical to
  that which does the normal tracking.
\end{itemize}

\todo[inline]{Update version history}

\chapter{Input Structure} \label{InpStr}

The idea of RACETRACK input is to use a sequence of input blocks, each
block with a specific keyword in the first line, the keyword ``NEXT''
in the last line and the input data in the lines in between. The
keyword ``ENDE'' ends this sequence, and all blocks after this keyword
are ignored. This system makes it easy to read input and allows easy
change and addition of input blocks. It was therefore also used in
SixTrack\@.

\section{General Input}

\subsection{Program Version} \label{ProVer}

\subparagraph{Description} The {\em Program Version} \/input block
determines if all of the input will be in the input file \# 3 or if
the geometry part of the machine (see~\ref{MaGe}) will be in a
separate file \# 2.  The latter option is useful if tracking
parameters are changed but the geometry part of the input is left as
it is.  The geometry part can be produced directly from a MAD input
file (see~\ref{MADT}). 

\subparagraph{Keyword} FREE or GEOM \subparagraph{Number of data
  lines} 0

\subparagraph{Format} {\em keyword comment title}

\begin{description}
\item [keyword] The first four characters of the first line of the
  input file \# 3 are reserved for the keyword (FREE for free format
  input with all input in file \# 3; GEOM if the geometry part is in
  file \# 2)
\item [comment] Following the first four characters, 8 characters are
  reserved for comments
\item [title] The next 60 characters are interpreted as the title of
  the output file \# 6
\end{description}

\subsection{Print Selection} \label{PriSel}

\subparagraph{Description} Use of the {\em Print Selection} \/input
block causes the printing of the input data to the output file \# 6.
It is advisable to always use this input block to have a complete
protocol of the tracking run.

\subparagraph{Keyword} PRIN \subparagraph{Number of data lines} 0

\subsection{Comment Line} \label{ComLin}

\subparagraph{Description} An additional comment can be specified with
this block.  It will be written to the binary data files
(Appendix~\ref{Header}) and will appear in the post--processing output
as well.

\subparagraph{Keyword} COMM \subparagraph{Number of data lines} 1

\subparagraph{Format} A string of up to 80 characters.

\subsection{Iteration Errors} \label{IteErr}

\subparagraph{Description} For the processing procedures, the number
of iterations and the precision to which the processing is to be
performed are chosen with the {\em Iteration Errors} \/input block.
If the input block is left out, default values will be used.

\subparagraph{Keyword} ITER \subparagraph{Number of data lines} 1 to 4

\subparagraph{Format} Each data line holds three values as in
table~\ref{T-IteErr}, except for the fourth line one which the horizontal
and vertical aperture limits can be additionally specified. This has
been added to avoid artificial crashes for special machines.

\subsection{MAD -- SixTrack Conversion} \label{MADT}

\subparagraph{Description}

A converter has been developed~\cite{CONVERTOR} which is directly
linked to MAD8\@. It produces the geometry file \# 2; an appendix to
the parameter file \# 3 which defines which of the multipole errors
are switched on; the error file \# 16 and the file \# 8 which
holds the transverse misalignments and the tilt of the nonlinear kick
elements. It also produce a file (unit 34) with linear lattice
functions, phase advances and multipole strengths needed for resonance
calculations for the program {\it SODD}~\cite{SODD}. 
%A description of
%how to use the converter can be found in Appendix\ref{MADSIXC}.

\section{Machine Geometry} \label{MaGe}

\subsection{Single Elements} \label{SinEle}

\subparagraph{Description} The {\em Single Elements} \/input block
defines the name and type of linear and nonlinear elements, the
inverse bending radius or multipole strength respectively, and the
strength and length of the elements.  Linear and nonlinear elements
are distinguished by length; linear elements have a nonzero length and
nonlinear elements have zero length. Both kinds of elements can appear
in the input block in arbitrary order. The input line has a different
format for linear and nonlinear elements.  Moreover, the multipoles,
being a set of nonlinear elements, are treated in a special way. The
maximum number of elements is set as a parameter (see
Appendix~\ref{DSP}).

\subparagraph{Keyword} SING \subparagraph{Number of data lines}
variable

\subparagraph{Format} See the following three sections.

\subsubsection{Linear Elements} \label{LinEle}

\paragraph{Description}
Each linear single element has a name, type, inverse bending radius,
focusing and a nonzero length.

\paragraph{Format} {\em name type $ \varrho^{-1} $ K length}

\begin{description}
\item [name] May contain up to sixteen characters
\item [type] As shown in the table~\ref{T-LinEle}
\item [$ \varrho^{-1}$] Inverse bending radius in $\mathrm{m}^{-1}$
\item [K] Focusing strength in $\mathrm{m}^{-2}$
\item [length] Magnet length in meters
\end{description}

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{Different Types of Linear Elements}
\label{T-LinEle}
\scriptsize \centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|l|}
  \hline
  type & $ \varrho^{-1} $ & $K$ & description \\
  \hline
  0 & 0 & 0 & drift length magnet \\
  1 & X & 0 & horizontal (rectangular) bending \\
  2 & 0 & X & quadrupole (-- focusing, + defocusing) \\
  3 & X & 0 & horizontal (sector) bending \\
  4 & X & 0 & vertical (rectangular) bending \\
  5 & X & 0 & vertical (sector) bending \\
  6 & X & X & horizontal combined function magnet \\
  7 & X & X & vertical combined function magnet \\
  8 & X & 0 & edge focusing \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\normalsize
\end{table}

\paragraph{Remarks}
\begin{enumerate}
\item For the horizontal plane the bending radius is defined to be
  negative \mbox{($ \varrho < 0 $).} This is different from other
  programs like MAD \cite{MAD}.
\item $ K < 0 $ corresponds to a horizontal focusing quadrupole.
\item For the length of an edge focusing element (type=8) the same
  value must be used as for the corresponding bending magnet. A sector
  bending magnet is transformed into a rectangular magnet with an edge
  focusing element of positive length on either side, while for the
  opposite transformation a negative length is required.
\item It is important to note that the splitting of a rectangular
  magnet, which is sometimes necessary if multipole errors are to be
  introduced, does change the linear optics.  It is therefore
  advisable to replace the rectangular magnet with a sector magnet,
  which can be split without affecting the linear optics, and make an
  overall transformation into a rectangular magnet via edge focusing
  elements. Do not forget to use the total length of dipole as the
  length of the edge focusing element.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Nonlinear Elements} \label{NonEle}

\paragraph{Format} {\em name type $K_{n}$--strength r.m.s.--strength
  length }
\begin{description}
\item [name] May contain up to sixteen characters
\item [type] As shown in table~\ref{T-NonEle}
\item [$K_{n}$--strength] Average multipole strength
\item [r.m.s.--strength] Random multipole strength
\item [length] Must be = 0
\end{description}

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{Different Types of Nonlinear Elements}
\label{T-NonEle}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
  \hline
  type & strength & description \\
  \hline 0 & -- & observation point (for
  instance \\
  & &
  for aperture limitations) \\
  \hline 1 & $ b_{1} [\mathrm{rad} \cdot \mathrm{m}^{0}] $ &
  horizontal bending kick \\
  --1 & $ a_{1} $ &
  vertical bending kick \\
  \hline 2 & $ b_{2} [\mathrm{rad} \cdot \mathrm{m}^{-1}] $ &
  normal quadrupole kick \\
  --2 & $ a_{2} $ &
  skew quadrupole kick \\
  \hline
  \vdots & & \\
  \hline 10 & $ b_{10} [\mathrm{rad} \cdot \mathrm{m}^{-9}] $ &
  normal $20^{th}$ pole \\
  --10 & $ a_{10} $ & skew $20^{th}$ pole \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Remarks}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Because the horizontal bending magnet is defined to have a
  negative bending radius, the sign for normal elements is different
  from other programs like MAD, while skew elements have the same
  sign.
\item Again contrary to other programs the factor \mbox{$(n-1)$!}  is
  already included in the multipole strength, which is defined as
  follows:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item for normal elements \mbox{$ b_{n}(\mathrm{SixTrack}) =
     \frac{-1}{(n-1)!}  L_{element} b_{n}(\mathrm{MAD}) $}
 \item for skew elements \mbox{$ a_{n}(\mathrm{SixTrack}) =
     \frac{1}{(n-1)!}  L_{element} a_{n}(\mathrm{MAD}) $}
 \end{itemize}
\item Unlike in RACETRACK, the horizontal and vertical displacements
  do not fit into the 80 character input lines of SixTrack\@.  They
  have to be introduced in a separate {\em Displacements of Elements}
  \/input block (see~\ref{DisEle}).
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Multipole Blocks} \label{MulBlo}

\paragraph{Description}
A set of normal, normal--r.m.s., skew and skew--r.m.s. errors can be
combined effectively. The actual values for the strengths have to be
given in a separate {\em Multipole Coefficient} \/input block
(see~\ref{MulCoe}) which must have the same name. To consider the
curvature of dipoles which are replaced by drifts and dipole kicks
this block is used in two different ways.

\paragraph{Format} {\em name type cstr cref length}

\begin{itemize}
\item Marker for high order kick (default)
\begin{description}
\item [name] May contain up to sixteen characters
\item [type] Must be = 11
\item [cstr] The bending strength given in the {\em Multipole
    Coefficient} \/input block (~\ref{MulCoe}) is multiplied with this
  factor.
\item [cref] The reference radius given in the {\em Multipole
    Coefficient} \/input block (~\ref{MulCoe}) will be multiplied by
  this factor.  If it is zero the multipole block will be ignored.
\item [length] Must be = 0
\end{description}

\item Default + dipole curvature
\begin{description}
\item [name] May contain up to sixteen characters
\item [type] Must be = 11
\item [cstr] The bending strength [rad] of horizontal or vertical
  dipole.  \newline Internally the value is set to one to allow the
  processing of a multipole block (~\ref{MulCoe}).
\item [cref] The length [m] of the dipole that is approximated by a
  kick.  Internally this value is set to one to allow the processing
  of a multipole block (~\ref{MulCoe}).
\item [length] \hspace{-2mm}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item {\em length = -1} \/: horizontal dipole
  \item {\em length = -2} \/: vertical dipole
  \end{itemize}
\end{description}
\end{itemize}

The definition of the multipole strength in a block will be given in
(~\ref{MulCoe}).

  transition energy respectively.
\item [u0] Circumference voltage in [MV]

\item [h-sep] Horizontal beam--beam separation [mm]
\item [v-sep] Vertical beam--beam separation [mm]
\item [strength-ratio] Strength ratio with respect to the nominal
  beam--beam kick strength. This is useful, in particular for 4D, to
  allow for splitting one beam--beam kick into several (longitudinally
  close by) kicks.
\item [${\sigma\_\rm{hor}}^2$] when the flag $lhc=2$ is set in the BEAM block of the fort.3 file, this column represent the horizontal $\sigma$ for the strong beam $\rm{[mm^2]}$
\item [${\sigma\_\rm{ver}}^2$] when the flag $lhc=2$ is set in the BEAM block of the fort.3 file, this column represent the vertical $\sigma$ for the strong beam $\rm{[mm^2]}$
\item [${\sigma\_\rm{lon}}^2$] this variable is for future purposes, at the present it is always equal to zero.

\end{description}

\item [type] Type identifier is $+23$ and $-23$ for horizontal and vertical
  crab cavities respectively.

\subsubsection{Beam Position Monitor} \label{BPM}
\paragraph{Format} {\em BPMname 0 0 0 0}
\begin{description}
\item [BPMname] Must start with ``BP'' and maybe followed by forteen characters.
\end{description}

\paragraph{Remark}
This element dumps the coordinates of the 1st particle to the file with name {\em BPMname}.
The file contains 7 columns: $x$,$x'$, $y$,$y'$, $ct$,$\delta p/p$ and $E$.
Usual SixTrack units are used. Any number of BPM elements can be used but
the names must differ. 

\subsubsection{Other element types}

Some other elements, such as dipole edge (24), solenoid (25), multipole RF kicks ($\pm$26, $\pm$27, $\pm$28) are accepted by SixTrack, but they are not currently supported by the development team or tested for correctness.
It is therefore advised to not use these elements.

\subsection{Block Definitions} \label{BloDef}

\subparagraph{Description} In four--dimensional transverse tracking,
the linear elements between nonlinear elements can be combined to a
single linear block to save computing time.

\subparagraph{Keyword} BLOC \subparagraph{Number of data lines}
variable but at least one

\subparagraph{Format}
\begin{itemize}
\item first data line: {\em mper msym(1) \dots msym(mper)}
  \/(integers)
\item from second data line on: {\em block--name \{element--name\} }
\end{itemize}

\begin{description}
\item [mper] Number of super--periods. The following set of blocks is
  considered a {\em super--period}\/. The accelerator consists of {\em
    mper} \/super--periods.
\item [msym(i)] $\pm$ 1 for each super--period.  If \mbox{{\em
      msym(i)}=1,} \/the \mbox{{\em i}\/'th} super--period will be
  built up in the order in which linear elements appear in the blocks
  below. If {\em msym(i)}\/=--1, the super--period will be built up in
  reverse order.
\item [block--name] The name of the block with up to sixteen
  characters
\item [element--name] The element names have to appear as a linear
  element in the list of ``single elements'' (~\ref{LinEle}). If one
  line is too short to contain all the elements of a block, a line
  with additional elements to the same block can be added.  At least 5
  (five) blanks must appear at the beginning of the extra line so that
  names of blocks and names of linear elements in a block can be
  distinguished.
\end{description}

\subparagraph{Remarks}
\begin{enumerate}
\item When synchrotron oscillation is introduced, the linear elements
  can no longer be lumped into one block, because in that case even a
  drift length magnet is a nonlinear element with respect to the
  longitudinal plane. However, the block structure is still kept to
  make use of the speed--up in case one can restrict the studies to
  the four--dimensional case.
\item The maximum number of blocks and the maximum number of entries
  in each block are defined as parameters (Appendix~\ref{DSP}).
\item The inversion of a super--period ({\em msym(i)}\/= --1) is
  presently no longer allowed.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Structure Input} \label{StrInp}

\subparagraph{Description} The model of the accelerator is put
together by constructing a sequence of blocks of linear elements,
nonlinear elements, observation points, and possibly a cavity with the
keyword ``CAV'' used if this name does not appear in the list of
single elements (~\ref{SinEle}) with type $\pm 12$. In that case, its
parameters are given in the {\em Synchrotron Oscillations} \/input
block (~\ref{SynOsc}).

\subparagraph{Format} \{ {\em structure--element} \/$\vert$ CAV
$\vert$ GO \}

\begin{description}
\item [structure--element] Structure elements must appear as nonlinear
  and observation elements in the single element list or in the list
  of blocks of the {\em Block Definition} \/input block
  (~\ref{BloDef}).
\item [CAV] A cavity can be introduced by a keyword ``CAV''.
  This element does not appear in the single element list
  (~\ref{SinEle}).
\item [GO] Starting point: the keyword ``GO'' denotes where the
  tracking is started and where the tracked coordinates are recorded
  at each turn.
\end{description}

\subparagraph{Remark} Repetition of parts of the structure is
indicated by parentheses with a multiplying factor N in front of them.
If the left parenthesis ``(`` occurs in a line of input, the factor N
is expected to be found in the preceding characters. If the characters
are blank, N is set to 1.  The right parenthesis ``)'' signals the end
of the sequence to be repeated.

\subsection{Displacement of Elements} \label{DisEle}

\subparagraph{Description} This block allows to displace nonlinear
elements in horizontal and vertical positions.  With the r.m.s. values of
the horizontal and vertical displacements it is possible to achieve a
displacement that is different from element to element.

To simulate a measured closed orbit at the position of nonlinear
elements, it is convenient to use the {\em Displacement of Elements}
\/input block instead of trying to produce a closed orbit by dipole
kicks.

\subparagraph{Keyword} DISP \subparagraph{Number of data lines}
variable

\subparagraph{Format} {\em name xd xdrms yd ydrms}

\begin{description}
\item [name] Name of the element which is displaced
\item [xd] Horizontal displacement [mm]
\item [xdrms] R.m.s. of horizontal displacement [mm]
\item [yd] Vertical displacement [mm]
\item [ydrms] R.m.s. of vertical displacement [mm]
\end{description}

In the case of an AC dipole these variables are not meant for
displacing this element but are used for the following AC dipole
parameters:
\subparagraph{Format} {\em name nfree nramp1 nplato nramp2}
\begin{description}
\item [name] May contain up to sixteen characters
\item [nfree] Number of turns free of excitation at the begining of
  the run.
\item [nramp1] Number of turns to ramp up the excitation amplitude 
  from 0 to $ACdipAmp$.
\item [nplato] Number of turns of constant excitation amplitude. 
\item [nramp2] Number of turns to ramp down the excitation amplitude.
\end{description}

\subparagraph{Remark} In RACETRACK the displacements had been included
in the {\em Single Element} \/input block (~\ref{SinEle}). In SixTrack
they must be given in the separate {\em Displacement of Elements}
\/input block because of the limited length of one line of input.

\section{Special Elements}

One advantage of SixTrack, that has been adopted from RACETRACK, is
that it easily allows to define elements for a specific purpose. The
special elements implemented till now are found in this section.
All Special Elements should be written in the fort.3 file.

\subsection{Multipole Coefficients} \label{MulCoe}

\subparagraph{Description}

Sets of normal and skew multipoles of up to tenth order, each with an
r.m.s. value, can be combined with this block. The multipole kick is
calculated using a Horner scheme which saves considerably in
computation time. Moreover, using the multipole block reduces the
number of elements in the single element list (~\ref{SinEle}).

\subparagraph{Keyword} MULT \subparagraph{Number of data lines} 2 to
12

\subparagraph{Format}
\begin{itemize}
\item first data line: {\em name} \/$ R_{0}\ \delta_{0} $
\item data lines 2 to 12: $ B_{n}\ r.m.s.$--$B_{n}\ A_{n}\ r.m.s.$--$A_{n} $
\end{itemize}

\begin{description}
\item [name] Name of the multipole block which must appear in the list
  of single elements (~\ref{MulBlo}).
\item [$ R_{0} $] Reference radius (in mm) at which the magnet errors
  are calculated.  This makes it convenient to use values from field
  measurements.
\item [$ \delta_{0} $] Bending strength of the dipole (in mrad). Field
  errors of line 2--11 are taken to be relative to the bending
  strength.
\end{description}

\subparagraph{Remarks}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The $ B_{n} $ and $ A_{n} $ are related to the $ b_{n}, a_{n} $
  of the single nonlinear element (~\ref{NonEle}) in the following
  way:
  $$
  b_{n} = \delta_{0} B_{n} R_{0}^{1-n} 10^{3n-6}; \\
  a_{n} = \delta_{0} A_{n} R_{0}^{1-n} 10^{3n-6}
  $$
\item The sign convention and the factorial ($n$!) are treated as for
  the single nonlinear elements in (~\ref{NonEle}).
\item Multipoles of different names can be set to be equal using the
  ``ORG'' input block.
\item 22--poles are included (n = 11). By enlarging the parameter
  ``MMUL''(Appendix~\ref{DSP}) up to 40--poles (MMUL=20) can be
  treated. To make the change of MMUL effective, it is of course
  necessary to recompile the program.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Aperture Limitations} \label{ApeLim}

\subparagraph{Description} This input data block is used to introduce
additional collimators or aperture limitations in the machine.  Each
nonlinear element can be used for this purpose. Rectangular or
elliptical shapes of the aperture limitations are allowed. On top of
that there is a general (rectangular) aperture check at each non--zero
length element. The general aperture values are chosen to be large
enough (~\ref{T-DTP}) to define the short--term dynamic aperture.

\subparagraph{Keyword} LIMI \subparagraph{Number of data lines}
variable

\subparagraph{Format} {\em name type--of--limitation xaper yaper}

\begin{description}
\item [name] The name of any nonlinear (zero length) element in the
  {\em Single Element} \/input block (~\ref{NonEle}) except multipole
  blocks (~\ref{MulBlo}).
\item [type--of--limitation] Two types of aperture limitations are
  allowed: \newline ``RE'' for a rectangular aperture shape, i.e.\ 
  $$
  x_{i} < \mathrm{xaper}, y_{i} < \mathrm{yaper}
  $$
  ``EL'' for an elliptical aperture shape, i.e.\ 
  $$
  \frac{x_{i}^{2}}{\mathrm{xaper}^{2}} + \frac{y_{i}^{2}}
  {\mathrm{yaper}^{2}} < 1
  $$
\item [xaper] Aperture in the horizontal plane in mm
\item [yaper] Aperture in the vertical plane in mm
\end{description}

\subsection{Power Supply Ripple} \label{PowRip}

The RIPP block is been deprecated since release 4.5.20, and the functionality is now provided by the DYNK block (\ref{sec:DYNK}).
A fort.3 file containing a RIPP block is therefore no longer valid, and will result in an error message.
The description below is therefore only provided as a reference for those who need to convert old input files.

\paragraph{Description} If power supply ripple is to be considered
this input data block can be used. A nonlinear quadrupole is expected
as a ripple element (type=2 and zero length in the single element list
(~\ref{NonEle})), but in principle other nonlinear elements are also
allowed.  Ripple depth, ripple frequency and starting phase of the
ripple frequency are the input parameters.

\paragraph{Keyword} RIPP

\paragraph{Number of data lines} variable

\paragraph{Format} {\em name ripple--depth ripple--frequency start--phase nrturn}

\begin{description}
\item [name] Name of the nonlinear element in the ``single element''
  block (~\ref{NonEle})
\item [ripple--depth] Maximum kick strength of the ripple element, a
  quadrupole kick is usually expected
\item [ripple--frequency] Given in number of turns (a real value is
  allowed) of one ripple period
\item [start--phase] Initial phase of the ripple element
\item [nrturn] Initial number of turns, for prolongation runs the
  number of turn already done
\end{description}


\subsection{Dynamic Kicks}
\label{sec:DYNK}

\paragraph{Description}
The DYNamic Kicks module~\cite{DYNKpaper} allows time-dependent modification of the settings of single elements.
The supported elements and attributes are listed in Table~\ref{tab:DYNK_SET}.
%Currently supported are thin ``standard'' elements (type $\pm$1--$\pm$10~\ref{NonEle}) and crab cavities/RF multipoles (type $\pm$23, $\pm$26, $\pm$27 and $\pm$28~\ref{CrabCav}).
%Different element types support different attributes, where the standard elements support setting the multipole strength $K_n$ while crab cavities support setting of the voltage, frequency, and phase relative to the bunch.
The settings can be computed on-the fly using several functions, loaded from input files or a combination, as described in Table~\ref{tab:DYNK_FUN}.

Further, unless explicitly switched off using a NOFILE statement, DYNK produces an output file ``dynksets.dat''.
This file contains the setting of all elements and attributes for which DYNK is active.
It is written in all turns of the simulation, even if DYNK is not active in that exact turn.

\paragraph{Keyword} DYNK

\paragraph{Number of data lines} variable

\paragraph{Format}
There are four types of statements possible in a DYNK block, listed below.
On top of this, lines starting with ``/'' are treated as a comment and ignored.

\subparagraph{FUN} \emph{FUN function-name function-type arg1 arg2 arg3 \ldots}\\
This statement defines a function, i.e. something which when evaluated produces a numerical value which can be used to set the value of an element attribute.
The functions in DYNK all have a unique name, and they may take up to 7 arguments (a limitation imposed by the internal parameter \emph{getfields\_n\_max\_fields}).
The function type must be one of those listed in Table~\ref{tab:DYNK_FUN}.
A function may be defined so that it uses the result of another function, which must be defined above it in the DYNK block.
This requirement avoids any possibility for infinite recursion.
The functions are only evaluated when needed, i.e. when used by a SET statement in that turn.
The functions may thus be evaluated multiple times in one turn (if used by multiple SET statements which are active in that turn, or referenced by multiple other FUN statements which are themselves used more than once in that turn), or it may not be evaluated at all.
%All functions types have an index, which is used internally in place of the function type name.
The functions are always evaluated as a function of the current turn number $t$, which may be shifted by a turn-shift specified in a SET statement.

  GET        & \emph{element-name[string] attribute-name[string]} & 
  Extracts the original value of a setting, i.e. as specified in the SINGLE ELEMENT section (Sec.~\ref{SinEle}). Attributes as used for SET, see Table~\ref{tab:DYNK_SET}. \\*

  FILE       & \emph{filename[string]} &
  Loads the settings from file; the file is expected to be an ascii file with two columns where the first column is the turn number (should start at 1 and include all turns up to as long as is wanted), and the second column is the value for that turn number.\\*
  
  FILELIN    & \emph{filename[string]} &
  Similar to FILE, but any double can be used as the turn number as long as they are monotonically rising.
  When evaluated, the function interpolates from the line-segments specified in the file. \\*
  
  PIPE       & \emph{inPipeName[string] outPipeName[string] ID[string] fileUnit[int]} &
  Uses a pair of UNIX FIFOs, through which it can communicate with an external program.
  When evaluated, it sends a message through the outpipe, and then waits for a message on the inpipe which should contain the value the FUN should returned.
  The ID is used in case several DYNK PIPE FUNs are using the same outPipe and inPipe, so that the controlling external program can choose what to calculate.
  Note that it will use both \texttt{fileUnit} and \texttt{fileUnit+1}, and if several PIPE FUNs are using the same file, they must also use the same \texttt{fileUnit}.
  For more details, see the example below.
  Also note that PIPE is not available in the checkpoint/restart version of SixTrack.\\*
  
  RANDG      & \emph{seed1[int] seed2[int] mu[real] sigma[real] mcut[int]} &
  Returns a pseudorandom number generated from a Gaussian distribution.
  The mean value and width is controlled by \emph{mu} and \emph{sigma}, while \emph{mcut} is the maximum number of sigmas to generate numbersup to, set to 0 to disable this cut. 
  The integers \emph{seed1} and \emph{seed2} are the seed used to initialize the RANECU generator. 
  Note that every RANDG function defined in DYNK uses its own separate random number stream.\\

%   RANDU      & \emph{seed1[int] seed2[int] rangemin[real] rangemax[real] } &
%   Returns a pseudorandom number generated from a uniform distribution.
%   The values \emph{rangemin} and \emph{rangemax} define the interval of the uniform distribution.
%   The integers \emph{seed1} and \emph{seed2} are the seed used to initialize the RANECU generator. 
%   Note that every RANDU function defined in DYNK uses its own separate random number stream.\\

  
  \hline
  \rowcolor{blue!15}
  Filters & & \\*
  
  FIR        & \emph{N[int] filename[string] baseFun[string]} &
  Applies a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter of order \emph{N} to the function \emph{baseFun}.
  The output is given as $y[t] = \sum_{i=0}^N b_i*x[t-i]$, where $t$ is the current turn and $x[t-0]$ is the result of the most recent call to \emph{baseFun}.
  The coefficients $b_0 \ldots b_N$ and initial values of $x[t-0]\ldots x[t-N]$ are loaded from the given file \emph{filename}, which is a space-separated ascii file with three columns.
  These columns are (1) row index \emph{[int]}, (2) coefficients $b_i$ \emph{[float]} and (3) initial values of the $x[]$ array \emph{[float]}.
  The row indices are expected to go from $0$ to at least $N$ in steps of $1$.
  Note that the filter is stepped once per call, i.e. the array $x[]$ is shifted once every time the FUN is called.
  Also note that when called, the filter is first stepped, then the new value is filled into the first position in $x[]$, and finally the sum is evaluated.
  This means that the last value in the $x[]$ array is never used, while the first value ($x[t-0]$) is immediately pushed into $x[t-1]$ before the first evaluation.\\*
  
  IIR        & \emph{N[int] filename[string] baseFun[string]} &
  Applies an Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filter of order \emph{N} to the function \emph{baseFun}.
  This is very similar to FIR, except that it also uses its own previous outputs.
  The sum is thus written as $y[t] = \sum_{i=0}^N b_i*x[t-i] + \sum_{i=1}^N a_i*y[t-i]$.
  The file \emph{filename} is identical to that which is used for FIR, except for adding two more columns.
  These columns are (4) $a_0\ldots a_N$ \emph{[float]} and (5) initial values for the $y[]$ array \emph{[float]}.
  Note that $a_0$ is never used, and the value of $y[t-0]$ is pushed back to $y[t-1]$ before the first evaluation of the sum, such that $y[t-N]$ is never used.\\

  \item The final value \emph{Inom}, which is the value after the end of the ramp.
  \item The acceleration parameter \emph{A}, which describes how fast the current is growing in the first (parabolic) segment.
  \item The decelertation parameter \emph{D}, which describes how fast the current growths flattens out in the forth (parabolic) segment.
  \item The ramp rate \emph{R}, which describes the maximum ramp rate, seen in the third (linear) segment.

\subparagraph{SET} \emph{SET element-name attribute-name function-name first-turn last-turn turn-shift}\\
This statement defines an element setpoint, which changes an element/attribute to the value computed by the given function.
The \emph{SET} becomes active when the turn number reaches \emph{first-turn}, and switches off once \emph{last-turn} has been passed.
When switched off, the value applied in \texttt{last-turn} stays for the rest of the simulation, or until overwritten by another \emph{SET}.
If \emph{last-turn} equals -1, the \emph{SET} is active untill the end of the simulation.
The element type and attribute combinations which can be used in DYNK is shown in Table~\ref{tab:DYNK_SET}.

The argument \emph{turn-shift} is an integer (positive, negative, or zero) number which is added to the current turn number before computing the function.
Thus, in order to (as an example) apply an exponential decay from the value $v_0$ starting in turn $t_0$ using the function defined as $f(t) = V_0 \exp(-t/\tau)$,
a \emph{turn-shift} $-t_0$ should be applied.

In addition to changing single element attributes, it is also possible to use DYNK to change certain global attributes such as the reference energy.
This is done through the ``element'' \texttt{GLOBAL VARS}; for example one may want to simulate an energy ramp following the function \texttt{eramp} throughout the whole simulation.
For this, one would use the \emph{SET} command ``\texttt{SET GLOBAL-VARS E0 eramp 1 -1 0}''.
Because of this, SixTrack does not accept a real single element in \texttt{fort.2} named \texttt{GLOBAL-VARS} if \texttt{DYNK} is active.

\subparagraph{NOFILE}
The presence of this statement in a DYNK block switches off the normal writing of the output file ``dynksets.dat'' in every line, instead producing a file only containing the message ``\#\#\# DYNK file output was disabled with flag NOFILE in fort.3 \#\#\#''.
This can be useful to save disk space in very long simulations.

\subparagraph{DEBU}
This statement switches on extra ``debugging'' output from DYNK.
This can be useful if debugging the code or if debugging the input.

\paragraph{Output file \emph{dynksets.dat}}
When a DYNK block is present in the input file, a file ``dynksets.dat'' is created and in the current working directory.
Unless a \emph{NOFILE} statement is present, this file contains first a header ``\# turn element attribute SETidx funname value'', followed by rows of data in the format specified in the header.
This data is written for all element/attribute combinations and in all turns, wether a SET is active for this element/attribute in this turn or not.
If no \emph{SET} is active when the line is written out, the \emph{SETidx} is written as -1, and the \emph{funname} is ``N/A''.
If a SET is active when the line is written out, the \emph{SETidx} is the index of the currently active \emph{SET} statement, where the first statement occuring in fort.3 has index 1 etc.
Similarly, the \emph{funname} is the name referencing the currently active \emph{FUN} statement.

\paragraph{Examples}

\subparagraph{Replacement of RIPP block}
One use of the DYNK block is to replace the functionality of the RIPP block (Section~\ref{PowRip}).
The FUN type COSF\_RIPP is provided for exactly this purpose, and provides an exact replacement.
As an example, the RIPP block in the SixTest test-case prob1 looks like (slightly reduced in size):
\begin{verbatim}
RIPPLE OF POWER SUPPLIES------------------------------------------------
         dmqx1f50l5+2      3.2315D-10    224.9
         dmqx2af50l5+2    -3.2315D-10    224.9
         dmqx1f10mel5+2    2.5246D-16    0.0011245
NEXT
\end{verbatim}
This can be replaced by the following:
\begin{verbatim}
DYNK
NOFILE
FUN RIPP-dmqx1f50l5+2 COSF_RIPP 3.2315D-10 224.9 0.0
SET dmqx1f50l5+2 average_ms RIPP-dmqx1f50l5+2 1 -1 0
FUN RIPP-dmqx2af50l5+2 COSF_RIPP -3.2315D-10 224.9 0.0
SET dmqx2af50l5+2 average_ms RIPP-dmqx2af50l5+2 1 -1 0
FUN RIPP-dmqx1f20kl5+2 COSF_RIPP 2.5246D-12 0.56225 0.0
SET dmqx1f20kl5+2 average_ms RIPP-dmqx1f20kl5+2 1 -1 0
NEXT
\end{verbatim}
Here, each RIPP data line is replaced with two lines, one FUN statement for generating the function, and one SET statement for applying the value.
Note that the SET statements have an end-time ``-1'', meaning it is used untill the end of the simulation.
Also note the precense of the NOFILE flag, which is used to not generate a potentially very large (for very long simulations) dynkfile.dat output file.

\subparagraph{Starting tracking inside a bump}

This example was taken from the paper~\cite{DYNKpaper}, and demonstrates how a bump can be temporarilly disabled if the starting point of the tracking is inside of it.
The reason for doing this is removing the neccessity of generating a starting distribution with the bump already applied.
Here, the HL-LHC v1.1 lattice is used, with vertical crab cavities around the first interaction point (IP1, ATLAS), which is also the point where the tracking is started.
The crab cavities opening the bump are called CRAB\_IP1\_L1$\cdots$4, while the closing cavities are CRAB\_IP1\_R1$\cdots$4.
The DYNK block for this looks like:
\begin{verbatim}
DYNK
FUN zero CONST 0.0
FUN CV_1R1 Get CRAB_IP1_R1 voltage
FUN CV_1R2 GET CRAB_IP1_R2 voltage
FUN CV_1R3 GET CRAB_IP1_R3 voltage
FUN CV_1R4 GET CRAB_IP1_R4 voltage
SET CRAB_IP1_R1 voltage zero 1 1 0
SET CRAB_IP1_R2 voltage zero 1 1 0
SET CRAB_IP1_R3 voltage zero 1 1 0
SET CRAB_IP1_R4 voltage zero 1 1 0
SET CRAB_IP1_R1 voltage CV_1R1 2 2 0
SET CRAB_IP1_R2 voltage CV_1R2 2 2 0
SET CRAB_IP1_R3 voltage CV_1R3 2 2 0
SET CRAB_IP1_R4 voltage CV_1R4 2 2 0
NEXT
\end{verbatim}

Here, the function ``zero'' is defined such that it always returns 0.0, and is used to switch off the closing cavities in the first turn, i.e. when the beam exits the bump.
Further, the functions CV\_1R1$\cdots$1R4 and CV\_1L are used to store the original value of the voltages, without having to explicitly enter them into the DYNK block.

The SET statements then first sets the voltage of all the cavities to zero in turn 1, and then in turn 2 sets it to their respective ``switched on'' voltages.
The SET statements end after turn 2, but the last values are retained.

This means that when the simulation starts with the bunch in IP1, it exits the bump without any kicks from the closing crab cavities.
It then comes around (still in turn 1), and encountered the switched-on opening cavities CRAB\_IP1\_L1$\cdots$4, which crabs the beam.
After passing through IP1, the turn counter is increased from 1 to 2, triggering the SET statements to switch on the closing cavities CRAB\_IP1\_R1$\cdots$4 as well.

\subparagraph{Ramp and exponential decay of crab voltage, combined with a linear drift of crab phase}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{fail_voltagePhase2v2}
  \caption{Singals generate by DYNK example for ramp + exponential decay of crab voltage, and also linear drift of crab phase. Only the signals for CRAB\_IP1\_L1 are shown. The plot is made from the data in dynksets.dat.}
  \label{fig:DYNK_fail}
\end{figure}

This slightly more complicated example builds on the example given above.
It shows how to change two parameters (voltage and phase) of several objects.
It also demonstrates how functions can be chained together, making more complicated functions.
Some of the resulting functions are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:DYNK_fail}, and the DYNK block here looks like:
\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}
The first functions defined here are the same as above, storing the default values (as defined in the single element list) for the relevant elements and also zero.
Then follows a normalized linear ramp function ``ramp'', with gradient 0.02 = 1/50.
This is then used by the ``specialized'' ramp functions ``ramp\_R1$\cdots$R4'', which scales ``ramp'' so that the end point is the standard voltages for $t\in 0\ldots50$.

These functions are used to first set the crabs to 0.0 for the first 9 revolutions, and in the 10th revolution the ramp starts.
As the ``ramp'' function is defined starting at turn 0, a shift -10 or -11 is applied to the ramps.
The ramp is switched off after turn 60/61, leaving the crabs to be operating at the last SET value.

Further, we want to demonstrate a failure in the crab voltage.
This is done using an exponential decaying function $V(t) = V_0 \exp\left(-0.05 t\right)$, which is implemented as three chained functions:
\begin{description_alligned}{decayScaled}
\item[expCore] $f(t) = -0.05 t + 0.0$
\item[decay] $g(t) = \exp(f(t)) = \exp(-0.05 t + 0.0)$
\item[decayScaled] $h(t) = V_0 \cdot g(f(t)) = V_0 \cdot \exp(f(t)) = \exp(-0.05 t + 0.0)$
\end{description_alligned}
For the SET, the time $t$ is then shifted by -70 turns, so that the functions are evaluated starting at t=0.

\subparagraph{Detuning a cavity (accelerating or crab)}~\\
\todo[inline]{Write}

\subparagraph{Using the PIPE function}~\\
%Note: This example is referenced from the FUN table.

To use the PIPE functionality, add a FUN and SET to the DYNK block such as:
\begin{verbatim}
FUN pipe1 PIPE /tmp/pip1 /tmp/pip2 myID1 4242
SET  ACFCA.AR1.B1 voltage pipe1 10 -1 -9
\end{verbatim}
Then create the two pipes using the \texttt{mkfifo} UNIX command, e.g.\ \texttt{mkfifo~pip1} and \texttt{mkfifo~pip2} in the chosen directory.
When starting SixTrack, it will first open the input pipe (while reading the DYNK block), and wait for the external program to do the same.
This can be simulated by running \texttt{cat~>~pip1}; it is also possible to open the input pipe before starting SixTrack.
After opening the input pipe, SixTrack will open the output pipe, again this can be simulated by running \texttt{cat~pip2}, and again this pipe may be opened before starting SixTrack.
Note that when SixTrack ends, the output pipe will be closed, so the recieving \texttt{cat} process is terminated.

After opening the output pipe, SixTrack writes the line \texttt{DYNKPIPE~!******************!} to this file.
It then writes a line similar to \texttt{INIT~ID=myID1~for~FUN=pipe1} for each FUN using this output pipe.

During tracking, when one of the PIPE FUNs are called SixTrack writes a line similar to \texttt{GET ID=myID1 TURN=~1} to the output pipe.
Note that the turn number is the one passed to the FUN from SET, i.e. including any turn-shift.
It then waits for a single floating point number to be written (in ascii) to the input pipe, which is then read and returned from the FUN.

\subsection{Beam--Beam Element} \label{BeamBeam}

\subparagraph{Description} The beam--beam kick, including a separation
of the beams, is treated \`{a} la Basetti and Erskine~\cite{BasErs}
and implemented as in MAD~\cite{MAD}. However, a much faster but
nevertheless precise calculation using interpolation can be
used~\cite{ERIC}. For SixTrack version 3 the beam--beam is also
available in the 6D form \`{a} la Hirata~\cite{Hirata}. Lastly, the
linear coupling has been considered in 4 and 6 dimensional phase
space~\cite{ripbeam}. 

\subparagraph{Keyword} BEAM 
\subparagraph{Number of data lines} variable but at least one

\end{itemize}

\begin{description}
\item [partnum] (float) Number of particles in bunch
\item [emitnx,emitny] (floats) Horizontal and vertical normalized
  emittance respectively [$\mu m\cdot rad$]
\item [sigz,sige] (floats) R.m.s. bunch length [m] and r.m.s. energy
  spread
\item [ibeco] (integer) Switch (0 = off; 1 = on) to subtract the
  closed orbit introduced by the separation of the beams. It is
  recommended to always subtract it as it is not yet calculated in a
  selfconsistent manner.
\item [ibtyp] (integer) Switch (0 = off; 1 = on) to use the fast
  beam--beam algorithms developped in collaboration with G.A.~Erskine
  and E.~McIntosh.  The linear optics are calculated with ``exact''
  beam--beam kicks.
\item [lhc] For the LHC with its anti--symmetric IR the separation of
  the beams in one plane can be calculated by the $\beta$--function of
  the other plane. For flat beams (not anti-symmetric optics) the separation
  can be loaded from the fort.2 file. (0 = off; 1 = anti-symmetric; 2 = load from file).
\item [ibbc] Linear coupling considered in 4D and 6D (0 = off; 1 = on).
\item [name] Name of 6D beam--beam element. Beam--beam elements that
  do not appear will be treated as 4D kicks.
\item [ibsix] (integer) Number of slices of the 6D beam--beam kick.
  If {\it ibsix} is set to 0 this element is treated as a 4D element.
\item [xang] (float) Half crossing angle (angle the between the trajectories of the two beams) at this particular element [rad].
\item [xplane] (float) Crossing plane angle [rad].
\item [xstr] (float) Angle of the position of the slices in the boosted frame [rad] (i.e. $X = Z \sin(\mathit{xstr}) \cos(\mathit{xplane})$, $Y =Z \sin(\mathit{xstr}) \cos(\mathit{xplane})$ ).
  In absence of crabbing user should make sure \textit{xstr=xang}; in case the \textit{xstr} flag is not set then \textit{xstr=xang} is assumed and a warning is printed (since version 4.5.45).
\end{description}

\subparagraph{Remark} These beam--beam elements have beam--beam have
to appear in the single element list (~\ref{NonEle}) (type 20) together
with their horizontal and vertical beam--beam separations
(see~\ref{BBS}).

\subsection{``Phase Trombone'' Element} \label{Trombone}

\end{description}

\subparagraph{Remark} The user has to make sure that the above stated
conditions are fulfilled. When using the $mad\_6t$~\cite{CONVERTOR}
converter from MAD8 to SixTrack this is guaranteed to be the case. Note
also that the crossterms between the transverse plains are not
considered for the time being.

\subsection{Electron lens} \label{sec:elen}

\paragraph{Description} The electron lens module serves for reading in the input parameters for different types of electron lenses. Each e-lens also needs to be added as single element in the list of single elements. Currently only the ideal hollow electron lens is implemented.

\paragraph{Keyword} ELEN

\paragraph{Number of data lines} variable

\paragraph{Format} \emph{name type thetamax r2 r2ovr1 offset\_x offset\_y flag\_entrance flag\_exit}
A description of the input parameters for the different e-lens types is given in Table~\ref{tab:elen}. Currently only the ideal hollow electron lens is implemented in SixTrack (type ANNULAR).

\paragraph{Remark} The user has to check that the e-lens defined in the ELEN block is also defined in the list of single elements and vice versa. All parameters except for the type (type 29) are ignored in the single element definition.
The implementation of the ANNULAR type (ideal hollow e-lens) has no explicit energy-dependency, except for the user defined parameter \emph{thetamax} (see \cite{sixphys}).

\paragraph{Example} In the following we give some examples for e-lens definitions.

\subparagraph{ANNULAR} This example defines two electron lenses hel1 and hel2. The input block in \verb|fort.3| is then given by:
\begin{verbatim}

\section{Organising Tasks}

In this section the input data blocks are described, which are used to
organise the input structure.

\subsection{Random Fluctuation Starting Number} \label{FluNum}

\subparagraph{Description} If besides mean values for the multipole
errors (Gaussian) random errors should be considered this input data
structure is used to set the start value for the random generator.

\subparagraph{Keyword} FLUC \subparagraph{Number of data lines} 1

\subparagraph{Format} {\em izu0 mmac mout mcut} \/(integers)
\begin{description}
\item [izu0] Start value for the random number generator
\item [mmac] {\em \large -- Sorry: disabled for the time being, i.e.\ 
    mmac is fixed to be 1 --} \/({\small In the vectorised version the
    number of different starting seeds can be varied.  Each seed is
    calculated as \mbox{$ k \times izu0 $} where $k$ runs from 1 to
    {\em mmac} \/which can not exceed 5 to save storage space (see
    list of parameters in Appendix~\ref{DSP}).})
\item {\em mout} A binary switch for various purposes, so all options,
  as described below, can be combined. 
\begin{itemize}
\item {\em mout} \/= 0 : multipole errors internally created
\item {\em mout} \/= 1 : multipole errors read--in from external file
  
  External multipole errors are read--in from file 16 into the array
  of random values. To activate these values one has to set to a value
  of 1 the relevant r.m.s.--positions of the corresponding multipole
  blocks (~\ref{MulCoe}). The systematic components are added as usual
  and multipoles not found in the fort.16 are treated as for ({\em
    mout} \/= 0 ). An error is only detected if there are too few sets
  of multipoles in fort.16.
\item {\em mout} \/= 2: the geometry and strength file is written to
  file \# 4 in the same format as the input file \# 2; the multipole
  coefficients are written to file \# 9; name, misalignments and tilt
  is written to file \# 27 and finally name, random single multipole
  strength and both random transverse misalignments are written to
  file \# 31.
\item {\em mout} \/= 4: Name, horizontal and vertical misalignment and
  also the element tilt are read--in from file \# 8.
\item {\em mout} \/= 8: Name and 3 Random numbers for single kick
  strength and both random transverse misalignments and also the value
  of the tilt are read--in from file \# 30. 
\end{itemize}
\item [mcut] The random distribution can be cut by {\em mcut} \/sigma
  of the distribution. No cuts are applied for {\em mcut = 0}\/.
\end{description}

\subparagraph{Remarks}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The RANECU random generator \cite{RANECU} is used as it produces
  machine independent sequences of random numbers.
\item If the starting point has to be changed or another nonlinear
  element is to be inserted, this can be done without changing the
  once chosen random distribution of errors by using the {\em
    Organisation of Random Numbers} \/input block.
\item The description of an accelerator is fully contained in 4 files:
  fort.2 (geometry), fort.3 (tracking parameters and definition of
  multipole blocks), fort.16 (multipole errors) and fort.30 (random
  numbers of the single multipole kick, the horizontal and vertical
  misalignment and the value of the tilt). This block allows to write
  out the files \# 4, 9, 27, 31 which may serve as the input files \#
  2, 16, 8 and 30 respectively. The file fort.30 superseeds fort.8 if
  both files are read in.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Organisation of Random Numbers} \label{OrgRan}

\subparagraph{Description} Working on a lattice for an accelerator
often requires to introduce new nonlinear elements. In those cases
simply introducing this new element means that the previously chosen
random distribution of the errors will be changed and with it often
the linear parameters. This input data block is mainly used to avoid
this problem by reserving extra random numbers for the new elements.
It also allows to change the observation point without affecting the
machine. The random values of different nonlinear elements including
blocks of multipoles can be set to be equal to allow to vary the
number of nonlinear kicks in one magnet which clearly should have the
same random distribution for each multipolar kick. Finally multipole
sets with different name can be made equal with this input data block.

\subparagraph{Keyword} ORGA \subparagraph{Number of data lines}
variable

\subparagraph{Format} {\em ele1 ele2 ele3} \/The data lines can be set
in three different ways:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Ele1 = ``name'' where name $\ne$ MULT \\
  Ele2 = ignored \\
  Ele3 = ignored \\
  The nonlinear element or multipole set will have its own set of
  random numbers.
\item Ele1 = ``name1'' where name1 $\ne$ MULT \\
  Ele2 = ``name2'' \\
  Ele3 = ignored \\
  The nonlinear element or multipole block Ele1 has the same random
  number set as those of Ele2, if it follows Ele2 as the first
  nonlinear element in the structure list (~\ref{StrInp}).
\item Ele1 = ``MULT'' \\
  Ele2 = ``name2'' \\
  Ele3 = ``name3'' \\
  The multipole set ``name3'' is set to the values of the set
  ``name2''. random errors are not influenced in this case.
\end{enumerate}

\subparagraph{Remarks}
\begin{enumerate}
\item A simple change of the starting point, by placing a ``GO''
  somewhere in structure, used to change the machine optics as the
  random numbers were shifted, too.  Simply calling this block even
  without a data line, will always fix the sequence of random numbers
  to start at the first multipole in the structure.
\item This input data block must follow the definition of the
  multipole block, otherwise multipoles cannot be set equal (option
  3).
\item Do not use the keyword ``MULT'' in the single element list
  (~\ref{SinEle}).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Combination of Elements} \label{ComEle}

\subparagraph{Description} It is often necessary to use several
families of magnetic elements with a certain ratio $ R $ of magnetic
strength to perform corrections like tune adjustment (~\ref{TunVar}),
chromaticity correction (~\ref{ChrCor}) or resonance compensation
(~\ref{ResCom}).  The {\em Combination of Elements} \/input block
allows such a combination of elements.  The maximum number of elements
is defined by the parameter NCOM (see Appendix~\ref{DSP}).

\subparagraph{Keyword} COMB \subparagraph{Number of data lines}
variable

\subparagraph{Format} {\em e0 R1 e1 \dots Rn en}

\begin{description}
\item [e0] Reference element which appears in the input of the
  processing procedure
\item [e1, \dots, en] Elements to be combined with {\em e0}
\item [Rj] Ratio of the magnetic strength of element {\em ej} \/to
  that of element {\em e0}
\end{description}

\section{Processing}

This section comprises all the input blocks that do some kind of pre--
or post--processing.

\subsection{Linear Optics Calculation} \label{LinOpt}

\subparagraph{Description} The linear optics calculation input block
is used to make a printout of all linear parameters (magnet lengths,
$\beta$ and $\alpha$ functions, tunes, dispersion and closed orbit) in
the horizontal and vertical planes at the end of each element or
linear block.  The number of elements or blocks can be chosen.

\subparagraph{Keyword} LINE \subparagraph{Number of data lines}
variable but at least 1

\subparagraph{Format}
\begin{itemize}
\item first data line: {\em mode number--of--blocks ilin ntco E\_I E\_II}
\item other data lines: {\em name(1), \dots , name(nlin)}
\end{itemize}


\begin{description}
\item [mode] ``ELEMENT'' for a printout after each single element
  (\ref{SinEle}); ``BLOCK'' for a printout after each structure block
  (\ref{BloDef})
\item [number--of--blocks] (integer) The number of the blocks in the
  structure to which the linear parameter will be printed. If this
  number is set to zero or is larger than the number of blocks, the
  complete structure will be calculated.
\item [ilin] (integer) Logical switch to calculate the traditional
  linear optics calculation in 4D ({\it 1 = ilin}) and with the DA
  approach 6D ({\it 2 = ilin}).
\item [ntco] (integer) A switch to write out linear coupling
  parameters.
 \begin{itemize}
 \item {\em ntco} \/= 0 : no write--out
 \item {\em ntco} \/$\neq$ 0 : write--out of all linear coupled (4D)
   parameters including the coupling angle.  These parameters (name,
   longitudinal position, the phase advances at that location, 4
   $\beta$--, $\alpha$-- and $\gamma$--functions, 4 angles for
   coordinates and momenta respectively, plus the coupling angle
   [rad]) are written in ascii format on file \# 11.
   This write-out happens every \emph{ntco} turns.
 \end{itemize}
\item [E\_I, E\_II] (floats) The two eigen--emittances to be chosen to
  determine the coupling angle. They are typically set to be equal.
\item [names] (char) For {\em nlin} \/($\leq $ {\em nele}\/) element--
  and block names the linear parameters are printed whenever they
  appear in the accelerator structure.
\end{description}

\subparagraph{Remarks}
\begin{enumerate}
\item To make this block work the Tracking Parameter block
  (~\ref{TraPar}) has to used as well.
\item When the ``ELEMENT 0'' option is used a file unit \# 34 is
  written with the longitudinal position, name, element type,
  multipole strength, $\beta$ functions and phase advances in the
  horizontal and vertical phase space respectively. This file is used
  as input for the ``SODD'' program~\cite{SODD} to calculate detuning
  and distortion terms in first and second order. A full program suite
  can be found at: /afs/cern.ch/group/si/slap/share/sodd
\item If the ``BLOCK'' option has been used, the tunes may be wrong by
  a multiple of 1/2. This option is not active in the DA part ({\it 2
    = ilin}), which also ignores the ({\it NTCO}) option.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Tune Variation} \label{TunVar}

\subparagraph{Description} This input block initializes a tune
adjustment with zero length quadrupoles.  This is normally done with
two families of focusing and defocusing quadrupoles. It may be
necessary, however, to have a fixed phase advance between certain
positions in the machine. This can be done with this block by
splitting the corresponding family into two sub--families which then
are adjusted to give the desired phase advance.

\subparagraph{Keyword} TUNE \subparagraph{Number of data lines} 2 or 4

\subparagraph{Format}
\begin{itemize}
\item data lines 1: {\em name1 Qx iqmod6}
\item data lines 2: {\em name2 Qy}
\item data lines 3 and 4, optional: {\em name3 $\Delta Q$} \/and {\em
    name4 name5} \/respectively
\end{itemize}

\begin{description}
\item [name1, name2] Names of focusing and defocusing quadrupole
  families respectively (in the single element list (~\ref{LinEle})
\item [Qx, Qy] (floats) Horizontal and vertical tune {\em including}
  \/the integer part
\item [iqmod6] (integer) Logical switch to calculate the tunes in the
  traditional manner ({\it 1 = iqmod6}) and with the DA approach
  including the beam-beam kick ({\it 2 = iqmod6}).
\item [name3] Name of the second sub--family, where the first
  sub--family is one of the above ({\em name1} \/or {\em name2}\/)
  This second sub--family replaces the elements of the first
  sub--family between the positions marked by {\em name4} \/and {\em
    name5}\/.
\item [$\Delta Q$] Extra phase advance {\em including} \/the integer
  part (horizontal or vertical depending on the first sub--family)
  between the positions in the machine marked by {\em name4} \/and
  {\em name5}
\item [name4, name5] Two markers in the machine for the phase advance
  $\Delta Q$ with the elements of the second sub--family between them
\end{description}

\subparagraph{Remark} The integer has to be included as the full phase
advance around the machine is calculated by the program.

\subsection{Chromaticity Correction} \label{ChrCor}

\subparagraph{Description} The chromaticity can be adjusted
to desired values with two sextupole family using this input block.

\subparagraph{Keyword} CHRO \subparagraph{Number of data lines} 2

\subparagraph{Format} data lines 1: {\em name1 $Q'_x$ ichrom}
\subparagraph{Format} data lines 2: {\em name2 $Q'_y$}

\begin{description}
\item [name1/2] Names (in the single element list (~\ref{NonEle}) of the
  two sextupole families
\item [$Q'$] Desired values of the chromaticity: $Q'=\frac{\delta
    Q}{\delta (\frac{\Delta p}{p_o})}$.
\item [ichrom] (integer) Logical switch to calculate the traditional
  chromaticity calculation ({\it 1 = ichrom}) and with the DA
  approach including the beam-beam kick ({\it 2 = ichrom}).
\end{description}
\subparagraph{Remark} To make the chromaticity correction work well a
small momentum spread is required (DE0 in table (~\ref{T-IteErr})). It
sometimes is required to optimize this spread.

\subsection{Orbit Correction} \label{OrbCorr}

\subparagraph{Description} Due to dipole errors in a real accelerator
a closed orbit different from the beam axis is unavoidable. Even after
careful adjustment one always will be left over with some random
deviation of the closed orbit around the zero position. A closed orbit
is introduced by nonzero strengths of $ b_{1} $ and $ a_{1} $
components of the multipole block (~\ref{MulCoe}), horizontal and
vertical dipole kicks (~\ref{NonEle}) or displacements of nonlinear
elements (~\ref{DisEle}).  This input data block allows the correction
of a such a random distributed closed orbit using he first two types
in a ``most effective corrector strategy'' \cite{Auti}. For that
purpose correctors have to be denoted by {\em ``HCOR= ''} \/and {\em
  ``VCOR= ''} \/and monitors by {\em ``HMON= ''} \/and {\em ``VMON=
  ''} \/for the horizontal and vertical plane respectively. After
correction the orbit is scaled to the desired r.m.s. values unless they
are zero.

On file unit 28 the horizontal orbit displacement, measured at the
horizontal monitors, will be written together with the monitor number,
on file unit 29 the same is done for the vertical closed orbit
displacement. 

\subparagraph{Keyword} ORBI \subparagraph{Number of data lines}
variable but at least 1

\subparagraph{Format}
\begin{itemize}
\item first data line: {\em sigmax sigmay ncorru ncorrep}
\item other data lines: {\em ``HCOR= '' namec} \/or {\em ``HMON= ''
    namem} \newline or {\em ``VCOR= '' namec} \/or {\em ``VMON= ''
    namem}
\end{itemize}

\begin{description}
\item [sigmax, sigmay] Desired r.m.s.--values of the randomly distributed
  closed orbit
\item [ncorru] Number of correctors to be used
\item [ncorrep] Number of corrections \newline If {\em ncorrep=0}
  \/the correction is iterated until {\em ITCO} \/(see
  table~\ref{T-IteErr}) iterations or after the both desired
  r.m.s.--values have been reached.
\item [``HCOR= '' namec] Horizontal correction element of name {\em
    namec}
\item [``HMON= '' namem] Horizontal monitor for the closed orbit of
  name {\em namem}
\item [``VCOR= '' namec] Vertical correction element of name {\em
    namec}
\item [``VMON= '' namem] Vertical monitor for the closed orbit of name
  {\em namem}
\end{description}

\subparagraph{Remarks}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Elements can have only one extra functionality: either
  horizontal corrector, horizontal monitor, vertical corrector or
  vertical monitor. If the number of monitors in a plane is smaller
  than the number of correctors it is likely to encounter numerical
  problems.
\item The {\em ``HCOR= ''}\/, {\em ``HMON= ''}\/, {\em ``VCOR= ''}
  \/and {\em ``VMON= ''} \/must be separated from the following name
  by at least one space.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Decoupling of Motion in the Transverse Planes}
\label{LinDec} 

\subparagraph{Description} Skew--quadrupole components in the lattice
create a linear coupling between the transverse planes of motion. A
decoupling can be achieved with this block using four independent
families of skew--quadrupoles, which cancel the off--diagonal parts of
the transfer map. As these skew--quadrupoles also influence the tunes
an adjustment of the tunes is performed at the same time.

\subparagraph{Keyword} DECO \subparagraph{Number of data lines} 3

\subparagraph{Format}
\begin{itemize}
\item first data line: {\em name1,name2,name3,name4}
\item data lines 2 and 3: {\em name5 Qx} \/and {\em name6 Qy}
  \/respectively
\end{itemize}

\begin{description}
\item [name1,2,3,4] Names of the four skew--quadrupole families
\item [name5, name6] Names of focusing and defocusing quadrupole
  families respectively (in the single element list (~\ref{LinEle})
\item [Qx, Qy] (floats) Horizontal and vertical tune {\em including}
  \/the integer part
\end{description}

\subparagraph{Remark} A decoupling can also be achieved by
compensating skew--resonances (~\ref{ResCom}).  The two approaches,
however, are not always equivalent. In the resonance approach the
zeroth harmonic is compensated, whilst a decoupling also takes into
account the higher--order terms.

\subsection{Sub--resonance Calculation} \label{SubCal}

\subparagraph{Description} First order resonance widths of multipoles
from second to ninth order are calculated following the approach of
Guignard \cite{Gilbert78}. This includes resonances, which are a
multiple of two lower than the order of the multipole. The first order
detuning including feed--down from closed orbit is calculated from all
multipoles up to to tenth order.

\item [Ip] (integer) Is a switch to change the nearest distance to the
  resonance \mbox{$ e = nxQx + nyQy $.} In cases of structure
  resonances a change of $p$ by one unit may be useful.
 \begin{itemize}
 \item {\em ip} \/= 0 : $e$ is unchanged
 \item {\em ip} \/= 1 : \mbox{$ (e \pm 1) = nxQx + nyQy - (p \pm 1) $}
 \end{itemize}
\item [length] Length of the accelerator in meters
\end{description}

\subsection{Search for Optimum
  Places to Compensate Resonances} \label{SeaPla}

\subparagraph{Description} To be able to compensate a specific
resonance one has to know how a correcting multipole affects the
cosine and sine like terms of the resonance width at a given position
in the ring. This input data block can be used to find best places for
the compensation of up to three different resonances, by calculating
the contribution to the resonance width for a variable number of
positions. For each position the effect of a fixed and small change of
magnetic strength on those resonance widths is tested.

  integer $ip$ for each of the three resonances: \mbox{$ e = nx Qx +
    ny Qy - (p + ip) $.}
\item [namei] i'th name of a multipole of order $n$ , which has to
  appear in the single element list (~\ref{NonEle})
\end{description}

\subsection{Resonance Compensation} \label{ResCom}

\subparagraph{Description} The input block allows the compensation of
up to three different resonances of order $n$ simultaneously the
chromaticity and the tunes can be adjusted. For mostly academic
interest there is also the possibility to consider sub--resonances
which come from multipoles which are a multiple of 2 larger than the
resonance order $n$. However, it must be stated that the
sub--resonances depend differently on the amplitude compared to
resonances where the order of the resonances is the same as that of
the multipoles.

\subsection{Differential Algebra} \label{DifAlg}

\subparagraph{Description} This input block initiates the calculation
of a one turn map using the LBL Differential Algebra
package~\cite{DALIE}.  The use of this block inhibits
post--processing. The same differential algebra tools allow a
subsequent normal form analysis (see \cite{Forest89}).  A
four--dimensional version integrated in SixTrack is available as
described in sections~\ref{Normal} and~\ref{Corrections}.

\subparagraph{Keyword} DIFF.  \subparagraph{Number of data lines} 1 or

\item data line 2: {\em name(1),\ldots,name(ncor)}
\end{itemize}

\begin{description}
\item [nord] (integer) Order of the map
\item [nvar] (integer) Number of the variables (2 to 6).  {\em nvar}
  \/= 2,4,6 : two-- and four--dimensional transverse motion and full
  six--dimensional phase space respectively.  {\em nvar} \/= 5 :
  four--dimensional transverse motion plus the relative momentum
  deviation \mbox{$ \frac{\Delta p}{p_o} $} as a parameter.
\item [preda] Precision needed by the DA package, usually set to
  \mbox{{\em preda} \/= 1e-38}
\item [nsix] (integer) switch to calculate a $ 5 \times 6 $ instead of a $
  6 \times 6 $ map. This saves computational time and memory space, as the
  machine can be treated up to the cavity as five--dimensional (
  constant momentum ).

 \begin{itemize}
 \item {\em nsix} \/= 0 : $ 6x6 $ map
 \item {\em nsix} \/= 1 : $ 5x6 $ map \\
   ({\em nvar} \/must be set to 6; 6D closed orbit must not be
   calculated, i.e. \mbox{\em iclo6 = 0}~(\ref{IniCoo}) and the map
   calculation is stopped once a cavity has been reached and being
   evaluated.)
 \end{itemize}
\item [ncor] (integer) Number of zero--length elements to be
  additional parameters besides the transverse and/or longitudinal
  coordinates (i.e.\ two--, four--, five-- or six--dimensional phase
  space).
\item [name(i)] (char) {\em Ncor} \/names (~\ref{NonEle}) of
  zero--length elements (e.g dipole kicks, quadrupole kicks,
  sextupoles kicks etc.).
\end{description}

\subparagraph{Remarks}
\begin{itemize}
\item For {\em nsix = 1} \/the map can only be calculated till a
  cavity is reached.
\item If the 6D closed orbit is calculated, the $ 5x6 $ map can not be
  done, {\em nsix} \/is therefore forced to 0.
\item If nvar is set to 5, the momentum dependence is determined
  without the need for including a fake cavity. With other words: the
  linear blocks are automatically broken up into single linear
  elements so that the momentum dependence can be calculated.
\item If a DA map is needed at some longitudinal location one just has
  to introduce an element denoted ``DAMAP'' at that place in the
  structure, ``DAMAP'' has also to appear as a marker (zero length,
  element type = 0) in the single element list (~\ref{NonEle}).  This
  extra map is written to file \# 17.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Normal Forms} \label{Normal}

\subparagraph{Description} All the parameters to compute the Normal
Form of a truncated one--turn map are given in the {\em Normal Form }
\/input block. Details on these procedures including the next

\begin{description}
\item [nord] (integer) Order of the Normal Form
\item [nvar] (integer) Number of variables
\end{description}

\subparagraph{Remarks}
\begin{itemize}
\item The {\em Normal Form } \/input block has to be used in
  conjunction with the {\em Differential Algebra } \/input block that
  computes the one--turn map of the accelerator.
\item The value of the parameter {\em nord} \/should not exceed the
  order specified for the transfer map plus one.
\item The value of the parameter {\em nvar} \/should be equal to the
  number of coordinates used to compute the map plus eventually the
  number of correctors specified in the {\em Differential Algebra }
  \/input block.
\item the value $1$ for the off--momentum order is forbidden. This
  case corresponds to the linear chromaticity correction. It is in
  fact corrected by default when $par1 =1$ or $par2 =2$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Corrections} \label{Corrections}

\subparagraph{Remarks}
\begin{itemize}
\item The names of the elements specified in the {\em Correction }
  \/input block should be grouped according to the multipole type:
  first sextupoles, then octupoles $\ldots$ etc.\ 
\item In case of order--by--order corrections, at least one of the
  quantities $par1,par2$ has to be zero, i.e.\ the correction of
  tune--shift terms depending on both amplitude and momentum is not
  allowed (as stated in the previous section).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Post--processing} \label{PosPro}

\subparagraph{Description} It has been seen in the past that the
tracking data hold a large amount of information which should be
extracted for a thorough understanding of the nonlinear motion. It is
therefore necessary to store the tracking data turn by turn and
post--process it after the tracking has been finished. The following
quantities are calculated:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Lyapunov exponent analysis} This allows to decide if the
  motion is of regular or chaotic nature, and, in the later case, that
  the particle will ultimately be lost.  This is done with the
  following procedure:
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item Start the analysis where the distance in phase space of the two
   particles reaches its minimum.
 \item Study the increase in a double logarithmic scale so that the
   slope in a regular case is always one, while a exponential increase
   stays exponential when we have chaos.
 \item Average the distance in phase space to reduce local
   fluctuations, as we are interested in a long range effect.
 \item Make a weighted linear fit with an increasing number of
   averaged values of distance in phase space, so that an exponential
   increase results in a slope that is larger than one and is
   increasing. (The weighting stresses the importance of values at
   large turn numbers).
 \end{enumerate}
\item {\bf Analysis of the tunes} This is done either by the averaged
  phase advance method leading to very precise values of the
  horizontal and vertical tunes. A FFT analysis is also done.  With
  the second method one can evaluate the relative strength of
  resonances, rather than achieve a precise tune measurement. In both
  cases the nearby resonances are determined.
\item {\bf Smear} The smear of the horizontal and vertical emittances
  and the sum of the emittances are calculated in case of linearly
  coupled and un--coupled motion.
\item {\bf Nonlinear Invariants} A rough estimate of the nonlinear
  invariants are given.
\item {\bf Plotting} The processed tracking data can be plotted in
  different ways:
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item The distance of phase space as a function of amplitude
 \item Phase space plots
 \item Stroboscoped phase space
 \item FFT amplitudes
 \end{enumerate}
\item {\bf Summary} The post--processing results for a complete
  tracking session with varying initial parameters are summarised in a
  table at the end of the run.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{description}
\item [iav] (integer) Averaging interval of the values of the distance
  in phase space. Typically a tenth of the total turn number should be
  used as this interval.
\item [nstart, nstop] (integers) Start and stop turn number for the
  analysis of the post--processing (0 0 = all data used).
\item [iwg] (integer) Switch for the weighting of the slope
  calculation of the distance in phase space (0 = off, 1 = on).
\item [dphix, dphiy] Horizontal and vertical angle interval in radians
  that is used to stroboscope phase space. This stroboscoping of one
  of the two phase space projections is done by restricting the angle
  in the other phase space respectively to lie inside $\pm$ {\em
    dphix} \/or $\pm$ {\em dphiy}.
\item [iskip] (integer) This parameter allows to reduce the number of
  data to be processed: only each {\em iskip} \/sample of data will be
  used.
\item [iconv] (integer) If {\em iconv} \/is set to 1 the tracking data
  are not normalised linearly. Sometimes it is necessary to compare
  normalised to unnormalised data as the later will be found in the
  real machine.
\item [imad] (integer) This parameters is useful when MAD data shall
  be analysed ({\em imad} \/set to one).
\item [cma1, cma2] (floats) To improve the Lyapunov analysis for MAD
  data and in the case that the motion is 6D but the 6D closed orbit
  is not calculated the off--momentum and the path--length difference
  ($\sigma = s - v_o \times t$) can be scaled with {\em cma1} \/and
  {\em cma2} \/respectively (see also~\ref{SynOsc}). Please set both
  to 1.  when the 6D closed orbit is calculated.
\item [Qx0, Qy0] (floats) Values of the horizontal and vertical tune
  respectively (integer part) to be added to the averaged phase
  advance and to the $Q$ values of the FFT analysis.
\item [ivox, ivoy] (integers) The tunes from the average phase advance
  are difficult to be calculated when this phase advance is strongly
  changing from turn to turn and when the tune is close to 0.5, as
  then the phase may become negative leading to a deviation of one
  unit. This problem can partly be overcome by setting these switches
  in the following way:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item tune close to an integer: {\em ivox, ivoy} \/= 1
 \item tune close to half an integer: {\em ivox, ivoy} \/= 0
 \end {itemize}
\item [ires, dres] (integer,float) For the calculated tune values from
  the average phase advance method and the FFT--routine the closest
  resonances are searched up to {\em ires}\/'th order and inside a
  maximum distance to the resonance {\em dres}\/, so that \mbox{$ nx
    Qx + ny Qy < dres $ and $ nx + ny \le ires $.}
\item [ifh, dfft] (integer,float) For the FFT analysis the tune
  interval can be chosen with {\em ifh}\/.  To find resonances with
  the FFT spectrum, all peaks below a fraction {\em dfft} \/of the
  maximum peak are accepted.
 \begin{itemize}
 \item {\em ifh} \/= 0 : $ 0 \le Q \le 1 $
 \item {\em ifh} \/= 1 : $ 0 \le Q \le 0.5 $
 \item {\em ifh} \/= 2 : $ 0.5 \le Q \le 1 $
 \end{itemize}
\item [kwtype] {\large -- Disabled, set to 0 --} ({\small Terminal
    type, e.g. 7878 for the Pericom graphic terminals. For details,
    consult the HPLOT manual \cite{HPLOT}.})
\item [itf] Switch to get PS--file of plots
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {\em itf} = 0 : off
  \item {\em itf} = 1 : on
  \end{itemize}
\item [icr] {\large -- Disabled, set to 0 --} ({\small Switch to stop
    after each plot (0 = no stop, 1 = stop after each plot).}
\item [idis, icow, istw, iffw] Switches (0 = off) to select the
  different plots. If all values are set to zero, the HBOOK/HPLOT
  routine will not be called.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {\em idis} \/= 1 : plot of distance in phase space
  \item {\em icow} \/= 1 : a set of plots of projections of the
    six--dimensional phase space and the energy E versus the turn
    number
  \item {\em istw} \/= 1 : plot of the stroboscoped phase space
    projection by restricting the phase in the other phase space
    projection
  \item {\em iffw} \/= 1 : plots of the horizontal and vertical FFT
    spectrum with linear amplitude scale
  \item {\em iffw} \/= 2 : plots of the horizontal and vertical FFT
    spectrum with logarithmic amplitude scale
  \end{itemize}
\item [nprint] Switch to stop the printing of the post--processing
  output to unit 6 (0 = printing off, 1 = printing on).
\item [ndafi] Number of data--files to be processed \mbox{(units :
    from 90 to (90--ndafi+1)\hspace{3mm}).}
\end{description}

\subparagraph{Remarks}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The post--processing can be done in two ways :
\begin{enumerate}
\item directly following a tracking run by adding this input block to
  the input blocks of the tracking
\item as a later run where the tracking parameter file (unit \# 3)
  consists of only the {\em Program Version} \/input
  block~\ref{ProVer} (using the {\em FREE} \/option) and of this input
  block specifying the post--processing parameters followed by {\em
    ENDE} \/as usual
\end{enumerate}
\item The HBOOK/HPLOT routines are only used at the start of the main
  program for initialisation and termination. The actual plots are
  done in the post--processing subroutine. The routines are activated
  only if at least one of the plotting parameters ({\em idis, icow,
    istw, iffw}\/) is set to one.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Initial Conditions for Tracking}

\subparagraph{Description} For the study of nonlinear system the
choice of initial conditions is of crucial importance. The input
structure for the initial conditions was therefore organise in such a
way as to allow for maximum flexibility. SixTrack is optimised to
reach the largest possible number of turns. In order to derive the
Lyapunov exponent and thereby to distinguish between regular and
chaotic motion, the particle has a close by companion particle.
Moreover, experience has shown that varying only the amplitude while
keeping the phases constant is sufficient to understand the nonlinear
dynamics, as a subsequent detailed post--processing allows to find the
dependence of the parameter of interest on these phases.

\subsection{Tracking Parameters} \label{TraPar}

\subparagraph{Description} All tracking parameters are defined with
this input block, the initial coordinates are generally set here, too.
A fine tuning of the initial condition is done with Initial
Coordinates block (~\ref{IniCoo}) and the parameters for the
synchrotron oscillation are given in block (~\ref{SynOsc})

\subparagraph{Keyword} TRAC \subparagraph{Number of data lines} 3

\end{itemize}

\begin{description}
\item [numl] (integer) Number of turns in the forward direction
\item [numlr] (integer) Number of turns in the backward direction
\item [napx] (integer) Number of amplitude variations (i.e.\ particle pairs)
\item [amp(1), amp0] (floats) Start and end amplitude (any sign) in
  the horizontal phase space plane for the amplitude variations. The
  vertical amplitude is calculated using the ratio between the
  horizontal and vertical emittance set in the {\em Initial
    Coordinates} \/block (~\ref{IniCoo}), where the initial phase in
  phase space are also set. Additional information can be found in the
  {\em Remarks}\/.
\item [ird] (integer) Switch for the type of amplitude variation. In
  case {\em napx} \/= 1 the amplitude nstart is used.
 \begin{itemize}
 \item {\em ird} \/= 0 : amplitudes are varied between the amplitudes
   {\em amp(1)} \/and {\em amp0} \/with equal increments:
   $$
   delta = (amp0-amp(1)) / (napx-1)
   $$
 \item {\em ird} \/= 1 : amplitude variation to find an estimate for
   the short term dynamic aperture. The amplitude is increased or
   decremented corresponding to stable motion or particle loss
   respectively.  The change of amplitude is reduced each iteration
   \mbox{$i \le (napx-1) $} to:
   $$
   delta = (amp0-amp(1)) / 2^{i}
   $$
 \end{itemize}
\item [imc] (integer) Number of variations of the relative momentum
  deviation \mbox{$ \frac{\Delta p}{p_o} $}.  The maximum value of the
  relative momentum deviation \mbox{$ \frac{\Delta p}{p_o} $} is taken
  from that of the first particle in the {\em Initial Coordinates}
  \/block (~\ref{IniCoo}).  The variation will be between \mbox{$ \pm
    \frac{\Delta p}{p_o} (\mathrm{max}) $} in steps of \mbox{$
    \frac{\Delta p}{p_o} (\mathrm{max}) $ / ({\em imc--1}\/).}
\item[niu(1), niu(2)]
\item[numlcp]
\item[numlmax] 
\item [idy(1), idy(2)] A tracking where one of the transversal motion
  planes shall be ignored is only possible when all coupling terms are
  switched off.  The part of the coupling that is due to closed orbit
  and other effects can be turned off with these switches.
 \begin{itemize}
 \item {\em idy(1), idy(2)} \/= 1 : coupling on
 \item {\em idy(1), idy(2)} \/= 0 : coupling to the horizontal and
   vertical motion plane respectively switched off
 \end{itemize}
\item [idfor] Usually the closed orbit is added to the initial
  coordinates. This can be turned off using {\em idfor}\/, for
  instance when a run is to be prolonged.
 \begin{itemize}
 \item {\em idfor} \/= 0 : closed orbit added
 \item {\em idfor} \/= 1 : initial coordinates unchanged
 \item {\em idfor} \/= 2 : prolongation of a run, taken the initial
   coordinates from unit \# 13
 \end{itemize}
\item [irew] To reduce the amount of tracking data after each
  amplitude and relative momentum deviation iteration \mbox{$
    \frac{\Delta p}{p_o} $} the binary output units 90 and lower (see
  Appendix~\ref{Files}) are rewound.  This is always done when the
  post--processing is activated (~\ref{PosPro}). For certain
  applications it may be useful to store all data. The switch {\em
    irew} \/allows for that.
 \begin{itemize}
 \item {\em irew} \/= 0 : unit 90 (and lower) rewound
 \item {\em irew} \/= 1 : all data on unit 90 (and lower)
 \end{itemize}
\item [iclo6] This switch allows to calculate the 6D closed orbit
  using the differential algebra package. It is ignored in the regular
  tracking versions. It is active in all versions that link to the
  Differential Algebra package. This 6D closed orbit can be calculated
  from any longitudinal position contrary to earlier versions.

 \begin{itemize}
 \item {\em iclo6} \/= 0 : switched off
 \item {\em iclo6} \/= 1 : calculated
 \item {\em iclo6} \/= 2 : calculated and added to the initial
   coordinates (~\ref{IniCoo}).
 \item {\em iclo6} \/= 5 or =6: like for {\em 1} \/and {\em 2} \/but
   in addition a guess closed orbit is read (in free format) from file
   unit \# 33.
 \end{itemize}
\item [nde(1)] Number of turns at flat bottom, useful for energy
  ramping.
\item [nde(2)] Number of turns for the energy ramping.  {\em
    numl}\/--{\em nde(2)} \/ gives the number of turns on the flat
  top. For constant energy with \mbox{$ nde(1) = nde(2) = 0 $} the
  particles are considered to be on the flat top.
\item [nwr(1)] Every {\em nwr(1)}\/'th turn the coordinates will be
  written on unit 90 (and lower) in the flat bottom part of the
  tracking.
\item [nwr(2)] Every {\em nwr(2)}\/'th turn the coordinates in the
  ramping region will be written on unit 90 (and lower).
\item [nwr(3)] Every {\em nwr(3)}\/'th turn at the flat top a write
  out of the coordinates on unit 90 (and lower) will occur.  For
  constant energy this number controls the amount of data on unit 90
  (and lower), as the particles are considered on the flat top.
\item [nwr(4)] In cases of very long runs it is sometimes useful to
  save all coordinates for a prolongation of a run after a possible
  crash of the computer.  Every {\em nwr(4)}\/'th turn the coordinates
  are written to unit 6.
\item [ntwin] For the analysis of the Lyapunov exponent it is usually
  sufficient to store the calculated distance of phase space together
  with the coordinate of the first particle ({\em ntwin} \/set to
  one). You may want to improve the 6D calculation of the distance in
  phase space with {\em sigcor, dpscor} \/(see~\ref{IniCoo}) when the
  6D closed orbit is not calculated with {\em iclo6} \/$\neq 2$. If
  storage space is no problem, one can store the coordinates of both
  particles ({\em ntwin} \/set to two). The distance in phase space is
  then calculated in the post--processing procedure
  (see~\ref{PosPro}). This also allows a subsequent refined Lyapunov
  analysis using differential--algebra and Lie--algebra techniques
  (\cite{Refine}).
\item [ibidu] Switch to creat or read binary dump of the full
  accelerator decription on file \# 32. The parameters relevant to
  tracking, i.e.\ {\em numl, amp0, amp(1), amp(2), damp, chi0, chid,
    rat, $x_1$, $x'_1$, $y_1$, $y'_1$, ${\sigma}_1$, $\frac{\Delta
      p}{p_{o1}}$, $x_2$, $x'_2$, $y_2$, $y'_2$, ${\sigma}_2$,
    $\frac{\Delta p}{p_{o2}}$, time0, time1}, are to be given via the
  tracking parameter file \# 3.
 \begin{itemize}
 \item {\em ibidu} \/= 1 : write dump
 \item {\em ibidu} \/= 2 : read dump
 \end{itemize}
\item [iexact] Switch to enable exact solution of the equation of motion into
  tracking and 6D (no 4D) optics calculations.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item {\em iexact} \/= 0 : approximated equation
              (e.g. $x'\simeq \frac{P_x}{P_0(1+\delta)}$,
                    $y'\simeq \frac{P_y}{P_0(1+\delta)}$);
    \item {\em iexact} \/= 1 : exact equation (e.g
      $x'\simeq \frac{P_x}{P_0\sqrt{(1+\delta)^2-P_x^2-P_y^2}}$,
      $y'\simeq \frac{P_y}{P_0\sqrt{(1+\delta)^2-P_x^2-P_y^2}}$ ).
 \end{itemize}
\end{description}

\subparagraph{Remarks}
\begin{enumerate}
\item This input data block is usually combined with the {\em Initial
    Coordinates} \/input block (~\ref{IniCoo}) to allow a flexible
  choice of the initial coordinates for the tracking.
\item For a prolongation of a run the following parameters have to be
  set :
\begin{itemize}
\item in this input block : idfor = 1
\item in the {\em Initial coordinates} \/input block :
\begin{enumerate}
\item itra = 0
\item take the end coordinates of the previous run as the initial
  coordinates (including all digits) for the new run.
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\item A feature is installed for a prolongation of a run by using
  \mbox{\em idfor = 2} \/and 
  reading the initial data from unit \# 13. The end coordinates are
  now written on unit \# 12 after each run. Intermediate coordinates
  are also written on unit \# 12 in case the turn number \mbox{\em
    nwr(4)} \/is exceeded in the run. The user takes responsibility to
  transfer the required data from unit \# 12 to unit \# 13 if a
  prolongation is requested.
\item Some illogical combinations of parameters have been suppressed.
\item The initial coordinates are calculated using a proper linear 6D
  transformation: {\em amp(1)} \/is still the maximum horizontal
  starting amplitude (excluding the dispersion contribution) from
  which the emittance of mode 1 $e_I$ is derived, {\em rat}
  \/(see~\ref{IniCoo}) is the ratio of $e_{II}/e_I$ of the emittances
  of the two modes. The momentum deviation $\frac{\Delta p}{p_{o1}}$ is used to
  define a longitudinal amplitude. The 6 normalized coordinates read:
\begin{itemize}
\item horizontal:\\

  $\sqrt{e_I}=\frac{amp(1)}
  {\sqrt{\beta_{xI}}+\sqrt{\left|rat\right|\times\beta_{xII}}}$,\\

  $0.$

\item vertical: \\

 $sign(rat)\times \sqrt{e_{II}}$, with $e_{II} =
 \left|rat\right|\times e_{I}$,\\

 $0.$

\item longitudinal: \\

$0.$,\\ 

$\frac{\Delta p}{p_{o1}} \times \sqrt{\beta_{sIII}}$

\end{itemize}
and are then transformed with the 6D linear transformation into real
space. Note that results may differ from those of older versions.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Initial Coordinates} \label{IniCoo}

\subparagraph{Description} The {\em Initial Coordinates} \/input block
is meant to manipulate how the initial coordinates are organise, which
are generally set in the tracking parameter block (~\ref{TraPar}).
Number of particles, initial phase, ratio of the horizontal and
vertical emittances and increments of \mbox{2 $\times$ 6} coordinates
of the two particles, the reference energy and the starting energy for
the two particles.

\begin{description}
\item [itra] (integer) Number of particles
 \begin{itemize}
 \item {\em itra} \/= 0 : Amplitude values of tracking parameter block
   (~\ref{TraPar}) are ignored and coordinates of data line 2--16 are
   taken. {\em itra} \/is set internally to 2 for tracking with two
   particles.  This is necessary in case a run is to be prolonged.
 \item {\em itra} \/= 1 : Tracking of one particle, twin particle
   ignored
 \item {\em itra} \/= 2 : Tracking the two twin particles
 \end{itemize}
\item [chi0] Starting phase of the initial coordinate in the
  horizontal and vertical phase space projections
\item [chid] Phase difference between first and second particles
\item [rat] Denotes the emittance ratio ($e_{II}/e_I$) of horizontal
  and vertical motion. For further information see the \emph{Remarks} of the TRAC input block in Section~\ref{TraPar}.
\item [iver] In tracking with coupling it is sometimes desired to
  start with zero vertical amplitude which can be painful if the
  emittance ratio {\em rat} \/is used to achieve it. For this purpose
  the switch {\em iver} \/has been introduced:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\em iver} \/= 0 : Vertical coordinates unchanged
\item {\em iver} \/= 1 : Vertical coordinates set to zero.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Remarks}
\begin{enumerate}
\item These 15 coordinates are taken as the initial coordinates if
  {\em itra} \/is set to zero (see above). If {\em itra} \/is 1 or 2
  these coordinates are added to the initial coordinates generally
  defined in the tracking parameter block (~\ref{TraPar}). This
  procedure seems complicated but it allows freely to define the
  initial difference between the two twin particles. It also allows in
  case a tracking run should be prolonged to continue with precisely
  the same coordinates. This is important as small difference may lead
  to largely different results.
\item The reference particle is the particle in the centre of the
  bucket which performs no synchrotron oscillations.
\item The energy of the first and second particles is given
  explicitly, again to make possible a continuation that leads
  precisely to the same results as if the run would not have been
  interrupted.
\item There is a refined way of prolonging a run, see the \mbox{\em
    Tracking Parameters} \/input block (~\ref{TraPar}).

\item [dppoff]  Offset Relative Momentum Deviation \mbox{$ \frac{\Delta

\item [dpscor, sigcor] Scaling factor for relative momentum deviation
  \mbox{$ \frac{\Delta p}{p_o} $} and the path length difference
  ($\sigma = s - v_o \times t$) respectively.  They can be used to
  improve the calculation of the 6D distance in phase space, but is
  only used when {\em ntwin = 1} \/in the tracking parameter input
  block~(\ref{TraPar}). Please set to 1 when the 6D closed is
  calculated.
\end{description}

\section{Extra output files}
For some studies, extra output from the simulation is desired.
How to do this is described below.

\subsection{Dumping of beam population} \label{sec:DUMP}

\paragraph{Description}
The DUMP block allows the beam population (i.e.\ the position in phase-space for all the particles) to be written to file.
This can be done in any SINGLE ELEMENTS which are directly mentioned in the STRUCTURE INPUT part of fort.2 (BLOCs cannot be used).
The particles are dumped just after the kick is applied, and how often to dump (every turn, every second turn, etc.) is user-selectable.
Please note that each single element can only be selected once; it is possible to overcome this limitation by placing multiple markers with different names in the same position in the sequence.

\subparagraph{filename} is the name of the file to write to. This argument may be omitted (unless \texttt{first} and \texttt{last} are present, if so then \texttt{filename} must also be present), and if so the output file is named fort.\texttt{unit}.

\subparagraph{first} is the first turn where this dump should be active. This argument may be omitted if \texttt{last} is also omitted, and if so it defaults to turn 1.

\subparagraph{last} is the last turn where this dump should be active, -1 meaning ``untill the end of the simulation''. This argument may be omitted if \texttt{first} is also omitted, and if so it defaults to -1.

\subparagraph{HIGH} If present anywhere in the DUMP block this triggers high-precission output, meaning more digits in the output files.

\subparagraph{FRONT} If present anywhere in the DUMP block, this keyword triggers the DUMPed particles to be dumped in front of the element, i.e.\ before the kick.
This works for all elements, including BLOCs, when combined with the ALL ``element name''.
Note that FRONT is not yet supported for thick tracking, and trying to use this combination will produce a run-time error.

\begin{verbatim}
DUMP

\subsection{FMA analysis} \label{sec:FMA}

\paragraph{Description}
The FMA block generates the basic files needed for frequency map analysis (FMA). Explicitly, it returns one output file with calculated tunes and amplitudes for the files specified in the DUMP block, see Sec.~\ref{sec:DUMP}. For the calculation of the tunes ($Q_1$, $Q_2$ and $Q_3$) in normalized phase space, the normalization matrix is extracted from the LINE block (linear optics calculation in 6D, \ref{LinOpt}). The tunes $Q_1$, $Q_2$ and $Q_3$ are then calculated with the routine specified in the FMA block either in physical coordinates ($x$,$x'$,$y$,$y'$,$z$,$dE/E$) or normalized phase space coordinates and dumped to the file \verb|fma_sixtrack| together with the minimum, maximum and average normalized particle amplitudes and phases. 

\paragraph{Keyword}
FMA

\paragraph{Number of data lines}
variable, one for each file with particle amplitudes and tune calculation method

\paragraph{Format of input block}
The FMA block has to be proceeded by the LINE block (calculation of the normalization matrix) and the DUMP block (dump particle coordinates).
\begin{verbatim}
DUMP
element_name_1 1 unit_1 2 filename_1 first_turn_1 last_turn_1
element_name_2 1 unit_2 2 filename_2 first_turn_2 last_turn_3
NEXT
LINE
ELEMENT  0 2 1 emit_1 emit_2
NEXT
FMA
filename_1 method_1 fma_flag_norm_1
filename_2 method_2 fma_flag_norm_2
NEXT
\end{verbatim}
For the DUMP block (Sec.~\ref{sec:DUMP}) the frequency has to be 1 (dump every turn) and the file format has to be 2. For the linear optics calculation \ref{LinOpt}, the optics needs to be calculated at eatch element (mode ELEMENT), the number-of-blocks is then 0 and 6D linear optics calculation is required (\verb|ilin = 2|) in order to decouple the 6D motion. 

\subparagraph{filename}
one of the outputfiles specified in the FMA block preceding DUMP block.
\subparagraph{method}
method used to calculate the tune. Available methods are: \verb|TUNELASK|, \verb|TUNEFIT|, \verb|TUNENEWT1|, \verb|TUNEABT|, \verb|TUNEABT2|, \verb|TUNEFFT|, \verb|TUNEFFTI|, \verb|TUNENEWT|, \verb|TUNEAPA|. A short description of the different methods is given in Table~\ref{fma:tab:1}.
\subparagraph{fma\_flag\_norm}
flag for calculating the tunes with physical ($x$,$x'$,$y$,$y'$,$s$,$dp/p$) or normalized coordinates. The default is using normalized coordinates (\verb|fma_flag_norm=1|). For using physical coordinates explicitly set (\verb|fma_flag_norm=0|).

& TUNEFFTI &	Computes the tune as the FFT on a two dimensional plane, given n iterates of a map. The FFT is performed over the maximum mft which satifies $2^{\rm mft} <= n$.

\paragraph{Output file format}
The FMA block returns the output files \verb|NORM_filename*| containing the normalized phase space coordinates, where \verb|filename| are the filenames specified in the dump block, and the file \verb|fma_sixtrack| containing the initial, average, minimum and maximum amplitudes and the calculated tunes for each specified filename and method.

\end{table}
\paragraph{Example}
An input block to compare the tunes at element IP3 calculated over the interval $[1,4096]$ and $[5905,10000]$, and using the method \verb|TUNELASK| would look like:
\begin{verbatim}
DUMP
IP3 1 1030 2 IP3_DUMP_1 1 4096
IP3..1 1 1031 2 IP3_DUMP_2 5905 10000
IP3..2 1 1032 2 IP3_DUMP_3 1 4096
IP3..3 1 1033 2 IP3_DUMP_4 5905 10000
NEXT
LINE
ELEMENT  0 2 1 3.75 3.75
NEXT
FMA
IP3_DUMP_1 TUNELASK
IP3_DUMP_2 TUNELASK
IP3_DUMP_3 TUNELASK 0
IP3_DUMP_4 TUNELASK 0
NEXT
\end{verbatim}
where for \verb|IP3_DUMP_1| and \verb|IP3_DUMP_2| the tunes are calculated using normalized coordinates (default) and for \verb|IP3_DUMP_3| and \verb|IP3_DUMP_4| the physical coordinates are used (\verb|fma_norm_flag| equal 0). 

Note that all element names have to be different due to a limitation in DUMP module. This means practically, that one needs to insert additional markers (here \verb|IP3..1| etc.) in the SixDesk \cite{sixdesk1,sixdesk2} mask file prior to the SixTrack run. It is important to install the additional markers after cycling the machine if the machine is cycled at the location of the additional (e.g. \verb|IP3|), as they are installed in front of the element given in the from statement in the cycle command.

\chapter*{Conclusions}

Programs with large input structures like SixTrack tend to be far from
perfect, even though a cumbersome chase for program bugs and a lot of
polishing on the input structure has been performed.  Plenty of
comments and suggestions are therefore needed to further improve the
program.

\chapter{Acknowledgement}

I would like to thank my colleagues at DESY and CERN to help to find
nasty bugs and for a thorough check of the program. I would like to
thank Mikko Vaenttinen who helped to vectorise the program. He also
did most of the typing of the manuscript. Moreover, I want to express
my gratitude to F.~Zimmermann who helped to finish the
differential--algebra part in endless night sessions. Additions
concerning Normal Forms have been contributed by M.~Giovannozzi.
J.~Miles helped with the calculation of the 6D Courant--Snyder matrix
and its use to transform the tracking data in the post--processing.
W.~Herr is thanked for providing a software package used for the orbit
correction. L.H.A.~Leunissen extracted and adapted the 6D beam--beam
code of Hirata~\cite{Hirata}.

\chapter{List of Default Values} \label{Default}

\section{Default Tracking Parameters} \label{DTP}

Some of the parameters for tracking are set to non--zero values.  This
is done for instance to avoid as much as possible program errors such
as division by zero due to an erroneous input. The default values for
the {\em Iteration Errors} \/(~\ref{IteErr}) see table~\ref{T-IteErr}.

\section{Default Size Parameters} \label{DSP}

For large machines the arrays holding the machine parameters might
have to be increased.  The size of each of the dimensions of the
arrays is therefore defined as a parameter.  The default values are
adjusted to allow the treatment of a full LHC lattice: the tracking
version uses 50 Mb and the DA version 400 Mb.

\chapter{Data Structure of the Data--Files} \label{Header}

A common data structure for the programs MAD and SixTrack is agreed
on. Besides some minor differences this allows a straightforward
post--processing of data from either program. Each binary data--file
has a header which holds a description of the run with comments,
tracking parameters and 50 additional parameters for future purposes,
six of which are already specified in SixTrack\@.

Following this header the tracking data are written in n samples of
nine numbers preceded by the turn number. In the MAD format the number
of samples n is not restricted, whilst SixTrack writes only up to two
samples for the two particles for the Lyapunov--exponent method. Up to
64 particles (two per file) can be treated in the vectorised version
of SixTrack\@.

\end{table}

Note that in case the ``Single Track File'' option is enabled at compile time, multiple of these files (normally one per particle pair) are interleaved in a single file.
This is done by writing first all headers in order (i.e. first the header for initial particle/final particle 1/2, then 3/4, 5/6 etc.) and then the same for the tracking data.
The ``total number of particles'' field can always be read from the first header record, which gives the number of header records present in the file.
The two file formats are equivalent, i.e. they contain exactly the same data, and it is thus possible to convert losslessly between them.

Some of the post--processing data are written in Ascii--format on file
\# 10. This can be used for instance for plotting purposes. Each time
the post--processing routine is called 60 double precision numbers
(some of them still dummy) are added to the file.

The file with the errors (in: fort.16, out: fort.9) has the following
format: first line -- name of element; line 2--7 -- normal multipoles
order 1--18; line 8 -- normal multipoles of order 19 and 20; line
9--14 -- skew multipoles order 1--18; line 15 -- skew multipoles of
order 19 and 20. The strength definition is according to
block~\ref{MulCoe} and to be effective in fort.3 the random values of
the corresponding multipole block have to be set to 1.0. A word of
caution: when writing on file fort.9 the {\em total} \/multipole
strength is used, i.e.\ systematic and random part combined. File
fort.16 and fort.9 might therefore be different. When using fort.9 as
input (fort.16) the systematic part in fort.3 has to be set to 0.0.

Misalignment and tilt are in file \# 8 and \# 27 as input and output
respectively. The format is (a16,2x,1p,2d14.6,d17.9), i.e.\ name,
horizontal misalignment, vertical misalignment and tilt. The
misalignment is in units of [mm] the tilt in units of [mrad]. The
files \# 30 (in) and \# 31 (out) have the random single nonlinear
element kick, misalignments and tilt in the format:
(a8,1p,d19.11,2d14.6,d17.9). Misalignment and tilt in file fort.8 or
fort.30 is automatically activated while the random strength (strength
definition same as in block~\ref{SinEle}) needs an entry in the fourth
column in the geometry file fort.2. File \# 28 and \# 29 hold integer
counter and closed orbit displacement at a horizontal or vertical
monitor respectively.

As an option the 4D linear parameters can be dumped to file \# 11 when
the linear optics block~\ref{LinOpt} is activated. This can be used
for instance for a post--processing of linear coupling. 25 values are

With the parameter ``mout'' set to 2 or 3 in the ``Random
Fluctuation'' block (~\ref{FluNum}) the internally used multipoles are
written to file \# 9 in the same format as above. This file can
therefore be used as an input fort.16 file for a subsequent run.

% \chapter{MAD SixTrack Convertor} \label{MADSIXC}

% A special version of the MAD program has been generated that creates
% input files for SixTrack with the complete and exact description of
% the current accelerator model stored in MAD\@. This then allows a
% detailed comparison of the tracking results from both programs.

% The programs SixTrack and MAD \cite {MAD} are both used for particle
% tracking in realistic machines such as the LHC with all expected field
% errors up to the highest order, and with displacement errors of
% quadrupoles and possibly other elements. The LHC lattice and error
% description, however, exists only in MAD format due to its much
% greater flexibility and readability. If one wants to compare tracking
% results of the two programs one needs therefore a conversion of the
% current machine inside MAD into SixTrack format. In particular the
% generated random field and displacement errors have to be transmitted
% correctly since they influence the outcome of the long--term tracking
% greatly.

% To this end it was necessary to make a special MAD version that reads
% a machine description, expands it, generates the errors, and then
% performs the necessary transformations for SixTrack: different
% conventions for the signs of magnet forces, grouping of identical
% elements, concatenation of multiple drift spaces, creation of blocks
% of linear elements between nonlinear ones, a different description
% of field and position errors, and similar tedious questions had to be
% solved. The results of the transformation are then written into input
% files for SixTrack.

% The special MAD version is actually a full MAD (except for plotting)
% with an additional module for the SixTrack output.  This then allows
% the user to perform orbit corrections and other calculations inside
% MAD, and have the resulting modifications of the machine be
% transferred to SixTrack.  All position errors (including tilt errors)
% and field errors are transmitted.

% The converter works correctly for thin and thick lens lattices.  In
% the latter case, all dipoles and quadrupoles are split into two, and a
% multipole is inserted in the centre, except for orbit corrector
% magnets which are converted to thin lens.  Since MAD does not support
% field errors higher than third order for thick elements, the
% multipolar errors will have to be created with the corresponding thin
% lens model, or by some other means.

% The special MAD version accepts one additional command:
% \begin{verbatim}
%  sixt:
%       elem       = (up to 20) element names
%       lgelem     = (up to 20) lengths of the above elements
%       structure  = structure file name, default: "fort.2"
%       param_in   = name of a (mandatory, possibly empty)
%                    extra input file for MAD, default: "fort.3.in"
%       param_out  = parameter file name, default: "fort.3"
%       errors     = field errors file name, default: "fort.16"
%       poserr     = position errors file name, default: "fort.8"
