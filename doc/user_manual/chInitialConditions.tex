\chapter{Initial Conditions for Tracking} \label{InitCondTrack}

For the study of non-linear systems, the choice of initial conditions is of crucial importance.\index{initial conditions}
The input structure for the initial conditions was therefore organised in such a way as to allow for maximum flexibility.
SixTrack is optimised to reach the largest possible number of turns.
In order to derive the Lyapunov exponent\index{Lyapunov exponent}, and thereby to distinguish between regular and chaotic motion, the particle has a close by companion particle.
Moreover, experience has shown that varying only the amplitude while keeping the phases constant is sufficient to understand the non-linear dynamics, as a subsequent detailed post-processing allows to find the dependence of the parameter of interest on these phases.

A number of features have over time been deprecated or replaced by other modules in SixTrack.
Therefore there are a number of parameters that are no longer in use, but nevertheless have to be set to dummy values.
The Simulation (\texttt{SIMU}) and Distribution (\texttt{DIST}) blocks are intended to replace all of the blocks in this chapter.
These blocks take keyword/value sets instead of blocks of numbers, and are therefore easier to maintain.
The \texttt{SIMU} block (Section~\ref{Input:SIMU}) can currently be used to replace the \texttt{TRAC}, \texttt{INIT}, and \texttt{HION} blocks (Section~\ref{TraPar}), but note that the implementation may still have bugs, and is therefore considered experimental\index{SIMU}.

\section{Simulation Parameters} \label{Input:SIMU}

\textcolor{notered}{\textbf{Note:} This input block is experimental. It provides an alternative interface to the most used parameters of the \texttt{TRAC}, \texttt{INIT}, and \texttt{HION} blocks, and is intended to be used in combination with the \texttt{DIST} block.}

\bigskip
The Simulation block (\texttt{SIMU}) is intended to take the main simulation parameters, and replaces the \texttt{TRAC}, \texttt{INTI}, and \texttt{HION} blocks\index{SIMU}\index{Simualtion Block}.
If the \texttt{SIMU} block is present in \texttt{fort.3}, these blocks cannot be present.

If the reference particle mass is set in the \texttt{SIMU} block, the value provided in the \texttt{SYNC} block is ignored.

\bigskip
Some settings provided by the \texttt{TRAC} and \texttt{INIT} blocks are not supported by the \texttt{SIMU} block.
These are listed below.
The option to add closed orbit to generated particles is only supported for the amplitude scan, which is not supported by the \texttt{SIMU} block.
If you need this feature, please use the old input format.

    \texttt{nwr(4)}        & integer  & In cases of very long runs it is sometimes useful to save all coordinates for a prolongation of a run after a possible crash of the computer. Every \texttt{nwr(4)}'th turn the coordinates are written to unit 6. \\
    \texttt{ntwin}         & integer  & For the analysis of the Lyapunov exponent\index{Lyapunov exponent} it is usually sufficient to store the calculated distance of phase space together with the coordinate of the first particle (\texttt{ntwin} set to one). You may want to improve the 6D calculation of the distance in phase space with \texttt{sigcor, dpscor} (see~\ref{IniCoo}) when the 6D closed orbit is not calculated with \texttt{iclo6} $\neq 2$. If storage space is no problem, one can store the coordinates of both particles (\texttt{ntwin} set to two). The distance in phase space is then calculated in the post-processing procedure (see~\ref{PosPro}).

\paragraph{Remarks}~
\begin{enumerate}
    \item This input data block is usually combined with the \textit{Initial Coordinates}\index{INIT} input block (\ref{IniCoo}) to allow a flexible choice of the initial coordinates for the tracking.
    \item For a prolongation of a run the following parameters have to be set:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item in this input block: \texttt{idfor = 1}
        \item in the \textit{Initial coordinates} input block:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \texttt{itra = 0}
            \item take the end coordinates of the previous run as the initial coordinates (including all digits) for the new run.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item A feature is installed for a prolongation of a run by using \texttt{idfor = 2} and reading the initial data from file \texttt{fort.13}. The end coordinates are now written to \texttt{fort.12} after each run. Intermediate coordinates are also written to \texttt{fort.12} in case the turn number \texttt{nwr(4)} is exceeded in the run. The user takes responsibility to transfer the required data from \texttt{fort.12} to \texttt{fort.13} if a prolongation is requested. This feature can be used to effectively read in a custom-made beam distribution. The format of the file is one line per pair of particles; the meaning of the columns is exactly that of the \textit{Initial Coordinates}\index{INIT} input block (see Sec.~\ref{IniCoo} and Tab.~\ref{T-IniCoo}).
    \item As of version 5.0.3 the particle energy read from \texttt{fort.13} is re-calculated from the particle momentum offset to ensure these are consistent. The particle energy in \texttt{fort.13} is therefore ignored.
    \item Some illogical combinations of parameters have been suppressed.
    \item The initial coordinates are calculated using a proper linear 6D transformation: \texttt{amp(1)} is still the maximum horizontal starting amplitude (excluding the dispersion contribution) from which the emittance of mode 1 $e_I$ is derived, \texttt{rat} (see~\ref{IniCoo}) is the ratio of $e_{II}/e_I$ of the emittances of the two modes. The momentum deviation $\frac{\Delta p}{p_{0,1}}$ is used to define a longitudinal amplitude. The 6 normalized coordinates read:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item horizontal:\\
            \begin{equation*}
                \left[\sqrt{e_I} = \frac{\mbox{amp(1)}} {\sqrt{\beta_{xI}}+\sqrt{\left|\mbox{rat}\right|\times\beta_{xII}}}, \quad 0.0 \right]
            \end{equation*}
            \item vertical:\\
            \begin{equation*}
                \left[sign(\mbox{rat})\times \sqrt{e_{II}} \mbox{ with } e_{II} = \left|\mbox{rat}\right|\times e_{I}, \quad 0.0 \right]
            \end{equation*}
            \item longitudinal:\\
            \begin{equation*}
                \left[0.0, \quad \frac{\Delta p}{p_{0,1}} \times \sqrt{\beta_{sIII}} \right]
            \end{equation*}
        \end{enumerate}
        and are then transformed with the 6D linear transformation into real space. Note that results may differ from those of older versions.
    \item The amplitude scan is performed from \texttt{amp(1)} to \texttt{amp0} in steps of $\mbox{delta} = (\mbox{amp0} - \mbox{amp(1)}) / (napx-1)$. For the intermediate amplitudes, \texttt{delta} is added up for each step, however the last amplitude is guaranteed to be fixed to the given value. This enables ``control calculations'' by setting the first amplitude of one simulation equal to the last amplitude of another simulation, and unless there are calculation errors, they shall produce exactly the same results.
    \item Note that if \texttt{iclo6 = 2} and \texttt{idfor = 0} in the input file, then \texttt{idfor} is internally set to 1, as is seen in some outputs. This does not mean that the closed orbit is not added; the setting of \texttt{iclo6 = 2} simply takes precedence.

\paragraph{Remarks}~
\begin{itemize}
    \item These 15 coordinates are taken as the initial coordinates if \texttt{itra} is set to zero (see above). If \texttt{itra} is 1 or 2 these coordinates are added to the initial coordinates generally defined in the tracking parameter block (\ref{TraPar}). This procedure seems complicated but it allows freely to define the initial difference between the two twin particles. It also allows in case a tracking run should be prolonged to continue with precisely the same coordinates. This is important as small difference may lead to largely different results.
    \item The reference particle is the particle in the centre of the bucket which performs no synchrotron oscillations.
    \item The energy of the first and second particles is given explicitly, again to make possible a continuation that leads precisely to the same results as if the run would not have been interrupted.
    \item There is a refined way of prolonging a run, see the \textit{Tracking Parameters} input block (\ref{TraPar}).

\section{Initial Distribution from an ASCII file} \label{distBlock}

In addition to \texttt{fort.13} (see \emph{Tracking Parameters} input block, Sec.~\ref{TraPar}), it is possible to read a beam distribution from a plain ASCII file via the \texttt{DIST} block.
With respect to using \texttt{fort.13}, which basically specifies just the six particle coordinates for each pair of particles, the \texttt{DIST} block allows the user to specify further properties of the particles, like charge or mass, necessary in case of species different than the synchronous one.
There is also the possibility to echo the parsed information into a plain ASCII file.
The echo of the distribution takes place after all the arrays for longitudinal motion have been updated and after the closed orbit is applied, if requested by the user.

\bigskip
\begin{tabular}{@{}llp{0.7\linewidth}}
    \textbf{Keyword}    & \texttt{DIST}\index{DIST} \\
    \textbf{Data lines} & Variable \\
    \textbf{Format}     & Keyword/value
\end{tabular}

\paragraph{Format Description}~

Table~\ref{tab:distKeys} reports the available keywords and meaning of necessary values. The user has to specify the file from which the code should read the distribution; in case the user wants the echo of the read distribution, they need to specify a name as well.

Table~\ref{tab:distReadFileColumns} shows the format of the ASCII file from where the beam distribution is read, along with meaning of columns and units when necessary.
All particles must be listed, one per line.
No header is required.
Similarly, Tab.~\ref{tab:distEchoFileColumns} shows the format of the ASCII file where the read beam distribution is echoed, along with meaning of columns and units when necessary.
As for the file for reading the distribution, one particle per line is dumped.
A header is dumped as well.
