\chapter{Initial Conditions for Tracking} \label{InitCondTrack}

For the study of non-linear systems, the choice of initial conditions is of crucial importance.\index{initial conditions}
The input structure for the initial conditions was therefore organised in such a way as to allow for maximum flexibility.
SixTrack is optimised to reach the largest possible number of turns.
In order to derive the Lyapunov exponent\index{Lyapunov exponent}, and thereby to distinguish between regular and chaotic motion, the particle has a close by companion particle.
Moreover, experience has shown that varying only the amplitude while keeping the phases constant is sufficient to understand the non-linear dynamics, as a subsequent detailed post-processing allows to find the dependence of the parameter of interest on these phases.

A number of features have over time been deprecated or replaced by other modules in SixTrack.
Therefore there are a number of parameters that are no longer in use, but nevertheless have to be set to dummy values.
The Simulation (\texttt{SIMU}) and Distribution (\texttt{DIST}) blocks are intended to replace all of the blocks in this chapter.
These blocks take keyword/value sets instead of blocks of numbers, and are therefore easier to maintain.
The \texttt{SIMU} block (Section~\ref{Input:SIMU}) can currently be used to replace the \texttt{TRAC}, \texttt{INIT}, and \texttt{HION} blocks (Section~\ref{TraPar}), but note that the implementation may still have bugs, and is therefore considered experimental\index{SIMU}.

\section{Simulation Parameters} \label{Input:SIMU}

\textcolor{notered}{\textbf{Note:} This input block is experimental. It provides an alternative interface to the most used parameters of the \texttt{TRAC}, \texttt{INIT}, and \texttt{HION} blocks, and is intended to be used in combination with the \texttt{DIST} block.}

\bigskip
The Simulation block (\texttt{SIMU}) is intended to take the main simulation parameters, and replaces the \texttt{TRAC}, \texttt{INTI}, and \texttt{HION} blocks\index{SIMU}\index{Simualtion Block}.
If the \texttt{SIMU} block is present in \texttt{fort.3}, these blocks cannot be present.

If the reference particle mass is set in the \texttt{SIMU} block, the value provided in the \texttt{SYNC} block is ignored.

\bigskip
Some settings provided by the \texttt{TRAC} and \texttt{INIT} blocks are not supported by the \texttt{SIMU} block.
These are listed below.
The option to add closed orbit to generated particles is only supported for the amplitude scan, which is not supported by the \texttt{SIMU} block.
If you need this feature, please use the old input format.

    \texttt{ntwin}         & integer  & For the analysis of the Lyapunov exponent\index{Lyapunov exponent} it is usually sufficient to store the calculated distance of phase space together with the coordinate of the first particle (\texttt{ntwin} set to one). You may want to improve the 6D calculation of the distance in phase space with \texttt{sigcor, dpscor} (see~\ref{IniCoo}) when the 6D closed orbit is not calculated with \texttt{iclo6} $\neq 2$. If storage space is no problem, one can store the coordinates of both particles (\texttt{ntwin} set to two). The distance in phase space is then calculated in the post-processing procedure (see~\ref{PosPro}).

\paragraph{Remarks}~
\begin{enumerate}
    \item This input data block is usually combined with the \textit{Initial Coordinates}\index{INIT} input block (\ref{IniCoo}) to allow a flexible choice of the initial coordinates for the tracking.
    \item For a prolongation of a run the following parameters have to be set:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item in this input block: \texttt{idfor = 1}
        \item in the \textit{Initial coordinates} input block:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \texttt{itra = 0}
            \item take the end coordinates of the previous run as the initial coordinates (including all digits) for the new run.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item A feature is installed for a prolongation of a run by using \texttt{idfor = 2} and reading the initial data from file \texttt{fort.13}. The end coordinates are now written to \texttt{fort.12} after each run. Intermediate coordinates are also written to \texttt{fort.12} in case the turn number \texttt{nwr(4)} is exceeded in the run. The user takes responsibility to transfer the required data from \texttt{fort.12} to \texttt{fort.13} if a prolongation is requested. This feature can be used to effectively read in a custom-made beam distribution. The format of the file is one line per pair of particles; the meaning of the columns is exactly that of the \textit{Initial Coordinates}\index{INIT} input block (see Sec.~\ref{IniCoo} and Tab.~\ref{T-IniCoo}).
    \item As of version 5.2 the particle momentum offset from \texttt{fort.13} is re-calculated from the particle energy to ensure these are consistent. The particle momentun offset in \texttt{fort.13} is therefore ignored.
    \item Some illogical combinations of parameters have been suppressed.
    \item The initial coordinates are calculated using a proper linear 6D transformation: \texttt{amp(1)} is still the maximum horizontal starting amplitude (excluding the dispersion contribution) from which the emittance of mode 1 $e_I$ is derived, \texttt{rat} (see~\ref{IniCoo}) is the ratio of $e_{II}/e_I$ of the emittances of the two modes. The momentum deviation $\frac{\Delta p}{p_{0,1}}$ is used to define a longitudinal amplitude. The 6 normalized coordinates read:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item horizontal:\\
            \begin{equation*}
                \left[\sqrt{e_I} = \frac{\mbox{amp(1)}} {\sqrt{\beta_{xI}}+\sqrt{\left|\mbox{rat}\right|\times\beta_{xII}}}, \quad 0.0 \right]
            \end{equation*}
            \item vertical:\\
            \begin{equation*}
                \left[sign(\mbox{rat})\times \sqrt{e_{II}} \mbox{ with } e_{II} = \left|\mbox{rat}\right|\times e_{I}, \quad 0.0 \right]
            \end{equation*}
            \item longitudinal:\\
            \begin{equation*}
                \left[0.0, \quad \frac{\Delta p}{p_{0,1}} \times \sqrt{\beta_{sIII}} \right]
            \end{equation*}
        \end{enumerate}
        and are then transformed with the 6D linear transformation into real space. Note that results may differ from those of older versions.
    \item The amplitude scan is performed from \texttt{amp(1)} to \texttt{amp0} in steps of $\mbox{delta} = (\mbox{amp0} - \mbox{amp(1)}) / (napx-1)$. For the intermediate amplitudes, \texttt{delta} is added up for each step, however the last amplitude is guaranteed to be fixed to the given value. This enables ``control calculations'' by setting the first amplitude of one simulation equal to the last amplitude of another simulation, and unless there are calculation errors, they shall produce exactly the same results.
    \item Note that if \texttt{iclo6 = 2} and \texttt{idfor = 0} in the input file, then \texttt{idfor} is internally set to 1, as is seen in some outputs. This does not mean that the closed orbit is not added; the setting of \texttt{iclo6 = 2} simply takes precedence.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Remarks}~
\begin{itemize}
    \item These 15 coordinates are taken as the initial coordinates if \texttt{itra} is set to zero (see above). If \texttt{itra} is 1 or 2 these coordinates are added to the initial coordinates generally defined in the tracking parameter block (\ref{TraPar}). This procedure seems complicated but it allows freely to define the initial difference between the two twin particles. It also allows in case a tracking run should be prolonged to continue with precisely the same coordinates. This is important as small difference may lead to largely different results.
    \item The reference particle is the particle in the centre of the bucket which performs no synchrotron oscillations.
    \item The energy of the first and second particles is given explicitly, again to make possible a continuation that leads precisely to the same results as if the run would not have been interrupted.
    \item There is a refined way of prolonging a run, see the \textit{Tracking Parameters} input block (\ref{TraPar}).

\section{Tracking with Ions} \label{hions}

The default tracking in SixTrack is for protons.
In case tracking of ions is wanted the following input block should be used.\index{ion tracking}

\section{Random Numbers} \label{Input:RAND}

The \texttt{RAND} block configures and initialises the pseudo-random number generator used by some parts of SixTrack.\index{random numbers}
The block allows the user to set a master seed that generates a reproducible sequence of numbers, or alternatively seed the generator with a clock seed by providing the word \texttt{TIME} in place of a seed number.
The \texttt{SEED} keyword is required, and if it is a number, it must be larger than 0.

The main random number generator in this module is RANLUX \cite{ranlux}.
The RANECU \cite{ranecu1,ranecu2} generator used by the magnet error code is also available.
It is possible to override the default generator for the block with the \texttt{OVERRIDE} keyword.
This will force the initialisation of all random number series to set the generator provided.

The ``Luxury level'' of the RANLUX generator is by default set to 3.
This can be overridden by the \texttt{LUXLEVEL} keyword.

Some modules in SixTrack uses its own seeds and initialisation of random numbers.
Please refer to the sections for the individual blocks for which feature requires this module.
The original magnet error block is one such module (see Secyion~\ref{FluNum}).

\section{Initial Distribution} \label{distBlock}

The \texttt{DIST} block adds the ability to read a beam distribution from file, or generate it internally in SixTrack.\index{DIST}\index{initial distribution}
The file format is very flexible and can be specified column-wise with the \texttt{FORMAT} keyword to support many file layouts.
It is also possible to specify the unit of the data in the input file, within a limited range.
If no format is specified, the \texttt{DIST} block falls back to the fixed 14 column format read by the original simple \texttt{DIST} block prior to version 5.3.1 (see Table~\ref{tab:distReadFileColumns}).

\bigskip
\begin{tabular}{@{}lp{0.7\linewidth}}
    \textbf{Keyword}    & \texttt{DIST}\index{DIST} \\
    \textbf{Data lines} & Variable \\
    \textbf{Format}     & Keyword/value
\end{tabular}

\paragraph{Format Description}~\\

There are several approaches available for initiating the beam distribution.
It can be read in its entirety from a file, selecting a set of many available conventions for describing the particle coordinates, ion values and meta data.
For a small number of particles, the coordinates can be set directly in the \texttt{DIST} block as well.

The \texttt{DIST} block is linked to the external \texttt{DISTlib} library for beam distributions, and the filled particle coordinates can be passed on to this library for further processing, like applying the T-matrix (see Section~\ref{Sec:TMatrix}).
In the future, more features will be added to this library, and made available through the \texttt{DIST} block interface.

Table~\ref{Table:DIST} lists the currently available keywords of the \texttt{DIST} block.
Table~\ref{Table:DIST_FORMAT} lists all the column formats the block supports.
Table~\ref{Table:DIST_FILL} lists all the available fill methods for populating the particle arrays without having to read from file.

For an overview of the definitions used for the particle tracking variables in SixTrack, see Section~\ref{Sec:PartArrays}.

\paragraph{Default Behaviour}~\\

Since there are multiple ways to set the particle coordinates, a few default behaviours and precedences have been coded into the parsing.

\begin{itemize}
    \item All particle coordinates are initially set to 0, with the exception of particle energy, which defaults to the reference energy. That is, the particle $\delta$ momentum is 0.
    \item The particle mass and ion parameters also default to those of the reference particle.
    \item The particle ID, if not provided, is set as a range from 1 to the number of particles as specified in the \texttt{TRAC} or \texttt{SIMU} block.
    \item The particle parent ID is set to equal that of its ID. This is the correct way to indicate that a particle is a primary particle.
\end{itemize}

It is only possible to set each particle coordinate using one method.
If conflicting methods are selected in the \texttt{FORMAT} keyword and in \texttt{FILL} methods, an error will be raised.
Since SixTrack uses multiple arrays for different values related to the particle energy, these are calculated after initialisation from the input format chosen.

The default normalisation method is to use the internal T-matrix in SixTrack (see Section~\ref{Sec:TMatrix}).
Alternatively, Twiss and dispersion can be set in the block, or a new T-matrix provided.
These will then take precedence over the internal matrix.

All emittances default to 0, so if these are not set, the normalisation will also return arrays of zeros.

\end{center}

\subsection{Column Formats}

The \texttt{FORMAT} keyword allows the user to specify their own file format by providing a list of columns it contains.
The available formats and how they are converted to internal SixTrack particle coordinates are listed in Table~\ref{Table:DIST_FORMAT}.

Each column can optionally take a unit in square brackets, appended to the column name itself with no space in between.
The available units are also listed in the table for the column formats that support units.
If no unit in square brackets is provided, the parser defaults to the internal SixTrack units which are mm, mrad and MeV.

For units of energy $c=1$ such that for instance MeV, MeV/c and MeV/c$^2$ are equivalent.
The parser accepts the following notation: \texttt{MeV}, \texttt{MeV/c}, \texttt{MeV/c\^{}2}, and \texttt{MeV/c**2}.
Units are not case sensitive.

For units of length, the parser accepts the character \texttt{u} as an alternative to $\mu$.

\paragraph{Multi-Column Formats}~\\

To avoid the need for specifiying common combinations of columns, a set of multi-column keywords are also available.
They are translated directly into a group of columns in a pre-defined order.
using these keywords does not prevent the user from adding more columns to extend the format.

Note, however, that conflicting columns cannot be provided.
Only one column for each of the 6 particle coordinates is allowed at the same time.
If the file contains multiple columns for the same coordinate, the columns not in use can be disabled with the \texttt{SKIP} flag.

For backwards compatibility with the old \texttt{DIST} block, a format that matches the old 14 colum file is also provided.
For the recent addition of charge and PDGID, these columns must be added to this format.
If no format is specified, the default is the old 14 column format described in Table~\ref{tab:distReadFileColumns}.

\paragraph{Example}~\\

Below is an example of a \texttt{DIST} block using a 7-column input file with the length unit in millimetres.

\subsection{Filling the Columns}

The \texttt{FILL} keyword allows the user to fill the particle arrays with values generated based on a set of parameters.
These can be both pseudo-random distributions, value ranges, or fixed values.

The fills are processed \emph{after} particles are read from file or from direct \texttt{PARTICLE} declarations in the \texttt{DIST} block.
This makes it possible to overwrite certain values after reading from file.
The \texttt{FILL} feature can also be used to populate the arrays from scratch, which can be useful for filling the normalised arrays (see example below).

The different fill methods are listed in Table~\ref{Table:DIST_FILL}.

Note that the \texttt{PARENT} column cannot be filled.
The \texttt{SPIN} columns are also currently disabled with this feature.

Also note that the \texttt{FILL} methods cannot create corrolated distributions.
This can be achieved by using the normalised column formats, which triggers a normalisation after they have been filled.

If a fill method using random numbers is used, the random number generator also must be initialised with the \texttt{RAND} block. See Section~\ref{Input:RAND}.

\bigskip
\noindent The general format for this feature is:
\begin{cverbatim}
FILL column method param1 ... paramN [firstIDX lastIDX]
\end{cverbatim}

\begin{tabular}{@{}lp{0.8\linewidth}}
    \texttt{FILL}     & The keyword selecting this feature. \\
    \texttt{column}   & The target column format. Must be one of the columns described in Table~\ref{Table:DIST_FORMAT}. \\
    \texttt{method}   & The fill method. Must be one of the methods described in Table~\ref{Table:DIST_FILL}. \\
    \texttt{params}   & The fill method parameters. These vary from method to method. See Table~\ref{Table:DIST_FILL}. \\
    \texttt{firstIDX} & Optional: The first paricle index for this fill method. Defaults to particle 1. \\
    \texttt{lastIDX}  & Optional: The last paricle index for this fill method, where -1 indicates the last particle as request in the \texttt{SIMU} or \texttt{TRAC} block. Defaults to particle -1.
\end{tabular}

\paragraph{Example}~\\

The example below fills the normalised coordinate arrays with Gaussian distributions with a sigma cut, and fills the particle ID and ion columns.
Writing to the normalised coordinate arrays in this manner triggers the normalisation routine to be called, here defaulting to use the internal T-matrix since no \texttt{TWISS} or \texttt{TMATRIX} keywords are set.
