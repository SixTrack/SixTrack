# SixTrack Changelog

### merged in master

**Bugfixes**

* Fix the root build. PR # 1040 (J. Molson)
* More robust detection of lxplus at compilation. PR #1045 (J. Molson).
* Fix pencil beam type 3 - the optics function at the entrance of the collimator were always used for beam sampling, even when those at the exit should have been used (e.g. because the beam is divergent on the cleaning plane). PR #1046 (A. Mereghetti).
* Do not update the pair mapping for non-primary particles. PR #1050 (A. Mereghetti)
* Increased number of digits for particle ID in FirstImpacts.dat and in collimator length in coll_summary.dat (to properly display crystal collimators which are usually a few mm long). First impacts on crystal collimators are now correctly flagged and a missing check on the `dowrite_impact` flag when writing Coll_Scatter.dat has been added. PR #1053 (M. D'Andrea)
* When collimator settings are required to match those read from an old format CollDB, a separate subroutine reconstructs the family settings based on the most frequent setting in each family. PR #1053 (M. D'Andrea)
* Do not perform the pair mapping when geant4 collimation is enabled.

**User Side Changes**

* When specifying `XP` and `YP` in the `FORMAT` statement of the `DIST` block, the units are parsed. Accepted values are [1], [1000], [MRAD], [RAD]. PR # 1054 (A. Mereghetti)
* Electron lenses have been inserted into FOX - PR #839 and #1056 (A. Mereghetti).
* Increased flexibility of e-lens module - PR #841 and 1056 (A. Mereghetti):
  * elens module fully dynamic allocatable;
  * give possibility to express R_1 and R_2 in sigma;
  * add any ion species to be defined as possible lens beam;
  * degenerate WIRE type of e-beam distribution is correctly handled;
  * other changes, including:
    * relativistic gamma of lens beam added to calculation of theta_R2;
    * removed remaining signs of chebyshev polynomials in elens module;
    * empty lines allowed in file describing the radial profile;
    * fixed bug in geometric normalisation factor of GAUSSIAN and RADIAL prpofiles;
  Documentation changed accordingly (user and physics manual).
* When sending particles to geant4, if the particle mass is within a tolerance of the geant4 value, update the mass to this value and re-scale the particle energy. PR # 1055 (J. Molson).
* If no collimator are found for a given family, the aperture of that family is set to zero. PR #1053 (M. D'Andrea)
* If a particle interacts with a crystal collimator after having previously interacted with another or the same crystal collimator, the process ID of the previous interaction is stored in cry_interaction.dat. PR #1058 (M. D'Andrea)

**Code Improvements and Changes**

* Removed updating napxo variable in the context of the Fluka-SixTrack coupling. This allows not to screw-up pair mapping in the context of DA studies. PR # 1052 (A. Mereghetti)
* Removed the un-used fluka_init_brhono function. PR # 1055 (J. Molson).
* Print error codes from the fluka coupling. PR # 1055 (J. Molson)
* Update FLUKAIO reference.
* Add Si as a possible collimator material for G4.

### Version 5.4.3 [19.12.2019] - Release

**Bugfixes**

* Fixed parsing of the `DIFF` block where only the first element name was parsed. The remaining elements were ignored. PR #1031 (F. Schmidt, V.K. Berglyd Olsen, J. Molson)
* Added a missing else statement in the DA code that was unintentionally removed when the exact drift code was added in 2014. PR #1028 (J. Molson, V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* Fixed the conversion of zeta to sigma in `DIST` and the user manual. It was previously assuming the inverse definition of `rvv` used by SixTrackLib. PR #1027 (R. De Maria, V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* Fixed a type definition inconsistency introduced by #878 that affected the ROOT interface. PR #1026 (J. Molson)
* Fixed the `CERNLIB` build system to support 64-bit. PR #1025 (F. Schmidt, J. Molson)
* Fixed a faulty loop in the FFT routine in post-processing. PR #1025 (J. Molson, F. Schmidt)
* Fixed a difference in sign in the thin combined function code. PR #1005 (T. Persson)

**User Side Changes**

* Minor changes to the formatting of `fort.18` to ensure correct column width. PR #1029 (J. Molson, F. Schmidt)
* Added better error reporting for the FLUKA interface. PR #1028 (J. Molson)
* Particles that pass through a collimator, but don't interact with it, no longer have their coordinates changed. Previously, these particles were shifted to the closed orbit, and had their units changed, for then to be changed back after the collimator. This added unnecessary numerical noise. PR #1023 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* The scatter module has been rewritten, and the PYTHIA integration updated to work with PYTHIA 8.243. This version allows for sending tracked particles, in terms of their momentum vector, as well as a sampled colliding particle, to the event generator, This means we no longer have to project a PYTHIA event onto the SixTrack particle, but can instead send the tracked particles back and forth between the codes. The Scatter and Pythia modules have been extended to allow for this. In addition, more density profile options have been added: collision with a reference particle at a given probability density, or a model of Beam 2 given by a set of Twiss parameters. The latter can also be set up to mirror Beam 1 using the internal optic parameters calculated by SixTrack. PRs #1017 and #1038 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

**Test Suite**

* Added a number of SixDA test to increase coverage of the Differential Algebra version of SixTrack. PRs #1030, #1032 (F. Schmidt, V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

**BOINC Interface**

* Extended the BOINC interface code to produce a new validation file for BOINC jobs. The new file supports a wider range of job types, especially jobs that do not produce a `fort.10` file. PR #878 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen, A. Mereghetti)

**Code Improvements and Changes**

* Cleaned up a number of unused variables throughout the SixTrack source code. PR #1037 (J. Molson)

### Version 5.4.2 [22.11.2019] - Release

**Bugfixes**

* Fixed a missing use statement in collimation under the `ROOT` compiler flag. Root support should now build again. PR #1015 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen, J. Molson)
* Removed one sigma cuts on all normal random distributions in the crystal module. These were ported over from the old version of the crystal collimation code, but never worked properly there due to a datatype bug. There should not be any such cuts in the physics in the first place, so they have now been removed. PR #1016 (M. D'Andrea, V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* Fixed an inconsistency in the splitting tool for `singletrackfile.dat` where the header was not padded with zeroes when files were split up into particle pair files. The padding was always in the post-processing code, but not in the read90 tool which the splitting tool was derived from. Since the test suite relies on the read90 tool, the split files still passed, but user analysis codes failed. The splitting tool is now consistent with SixTrack post-processing. PR #1013 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

**User Side Changes**

* The turn number in the particle state files is now the smallest of current turn and number of particle tracked turns. Previously, the default value was always the total number of turns, and only adjusted if a particle was lost before the end of tracking. This was misleading users to think that the `initial_state.dat` file wasn't really written before tracking, as the turn number was non-zero. PR #1013 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* The main crystal interaction file is now written only if the `WRITE_CRYCOORD` flag is enabled in collimation. The entrance and exit files are, in addition, only written when the global `DEBUG` flag is enabled in the `SETTINGS` block. PR #1019 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen, M. D'Andrea, A. Mereghetti)
* Added a command line flag `--notrack` that disables tracking in SixTrack. This allows for the checking of input files and simulation initialisation without running the full job. PR #1020 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

**Documentation**

* Documentation section for collimation updated to include crystal collimators. PRs #1012 and #1019 (M. D'Andrea, V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

### Version 5.4.1 [01.11.2019] - Release

**Bugfixes**

* Fixed an issue when opening `fort.208` when building with both FLUKA and G4COLLIMATION compiler flags at the same time. PR #1008 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen, J. Molson)
* Fixed a bug in the efficiency calculation where the vertical sigma was not correctly calculated when filling the histograms due to a missing set of parentheses. PR #987 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

**User Side Changes**

* The collimation module now supports crystal collimation. The crystal collimation code that was written based on an older version of SixTrack has now been updated and added to SixTrack 5. Using crystal collimators requires the use of the new collimator database format. PR #1004 (M. D'Andrea, V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* The collimation code is no longer hardcoded to assume LHC element naming convention. The collimator names are still processed assuming LHC convention when using the old input block and database format, but the new format does not rely on any naming convention. A collimator is a collimator if it's defined in the collimator database file. PR #970 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* Since the collimators are no longer dependent on naming convention, the collimator stage (primary, secondary, tertiary, etc) has to be specified in the database if an on-line analysis based on these are intended. This has been added as an optional parameter in the collimator family definition. PR #986 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* Collimator efficiency studies (histograps on normalised amplitudes) are now disabled by default, and need to be explicitly requested. A flag has been added to both the old and the new input block for this. The feature is by default disabled as it requires substantial amounts of memory relative to the total memory usage of SixTrack. PR #987 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* Aperture tilt in the input is now specified in degrees, not radians. PR #1003 (T. Persson)

**Code Improvements and Changes**

* This release includes a major clean-up of the collimation code. The old collimation module has been split up into separate modules. The K2 physics routines have been split out into their own module, and connected to the crystal collimation module. The funlux code has also been moved to a new module. A lot of statistics calculations and other sections of code have been extracted and put into separate routines to make the code both more readable and to avoid duplication of code. Many unused or unneeded variables have been removed, and collimator materials have been split out into a separate module; so has a lot of shared collimator variables. A test for the `tracks2.dat` file has been added. PRs #975, #987, #997, #998 and #1002 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen, A. Mereghetti)
* Exact drifts are now computed without first converting the coordinates to m and rad and then back to mm and mrad for each drift. This adds numerical noise and unnecessary CPU cost. PR #999 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* Cavities and phase trombone elements now uses the general routine for updating particle energy arrays, ensuring consistency between elements. PR #1001 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

### Version 5.4 [10.10.2019] - Release

**Bug Fixes**

* A series of long standing issues caused by uninitialised variables have been resolved. PRs #983 and #988 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen).<br>The following modules and settings were affected:
  * Beam--beam simulations with the `ibeco` flag set to 0. This caused `NaN` particle coordinates on some systems.
  * In the differential algebra version of SixTrack, the longitudinal part of the normalisation matrix was uninitialised when running in 4D, but the values still used in some calculations, causing `NaN` values on some systems.
  * When running SixTrack with the `ntwin` parameter set to 1, post-processing would still compute the amplitude for the second particle from values not being initialised. Now, if `ntwin` is not set to 2, these values are set to zero and the extra calculations skipped.
  * A number of variables were uninitialised in parts of the initialisation code when running 6D simulations (in subroutine `umlauda`), these have been cleared up, but are not known to have caused any issues.
* Fixed a bug in collimation where the collimator families were not generated when using the old database file format with the new `COLL` block format. PR #984 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen, M. D'Andrea)
* Fixed a bug in `aperture_losses.dat` where the header was missing the `#` char so that it can be identified as a comment line for analysis code. PR #995 (A. Mereghetti, V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* Fixed an issue with writing the header of `singletrackfile.dat` where SixTrack would skip to after tracking if it failed to write to file. PR #996 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen, A. Mereghetti)
* Added a check of `iostat` when closing file units in the internal file units handler module. Any error is reported to stderr and to log file. PR #996 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen, E. Mcintosh)

**User Side Changes**

* The STF build flag has been removed. That means SixTrack now always produces a single track file `singletrackfile.dat` instead of the optional pair track files `fort.59` - `fort.90`. A tool for converting the full track file to a pair track file has been added. See the user manual for further details. PRs #967 and 989 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen, K.N. Sjobak)
* A random numbers module has been added, which introduces the `RAND` block in the input file. The block gives more control over how the internal random number generators are initialised and also provides a better framework for the internal management of the various random number sequences used by different modules of the code. It is also designed to be easier to manage when using checkpoint/restart. Many modules still use their own seed, so this will be implemented gradually. Currently, the new random numbers module is only used by the `DIST` block. PR #978 (V.K Berglyd Olsen)
* The main debug file `dynksets.dat` in `DYNK` is no longer written by default. Previously, this file could be disabled with the `NOFILE` flag in `fort.3`. Instead, it now has to be explicitly requested with the `DYNKSETS` flag. PRs #992 and #993, solving issue #982 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* The `TILT` build flag has been removed. The feature is now always enabled. PR #985 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

### Version 5.3.4 [01.10.2019] - Release

**Bug Fixes**

* Fixing an error in the integration of the electron lens radial profiles from files. The error was twofold: (1) it had the wrong unit conversion from A/cm2 to A/mm2, and (2) integration was not deploying the rule of the trapezoid on the radius, but the lower square. PR #968 (A. Mereghetti)
* Minor fix where the collimation exit routine was not called if SixTrack was run in thin 4D mode. This only prevented some final summary files to be written, and had no effect on the simulation itself. PR #976 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen, M. D'Andrea)

**User Side Changes**

* Onesided collimators can now be set in the new collimation database. The LHC hard coded naming convention restrictions have been removed for the new database format, but are still in place for the old format. PRs #958 and #966 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen, A. Mereghetti)
* The option to slice the collimator jaw and apply a deformation has been added to the new collimator database format. The previous restrictions on LHC naming convention have been removed, and the slicing can now be applied to any collimator, with different fit models as needed. PR #969 (V.K Berglyd Olsen, A. Mereghetti)
* The number of beam--beam elements now scale dynamically with user input. It was previously restricted to 500 elements. PR #974 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

**Test Suite**

* A series of tests of the collimator jaw profiling has been added to ensure the code is stable through development stages. An additional output file for the jaw was added as well. PR #961 (A. Mereghetti)

**Code Improvements and Changes**

* The collimation jaw fit code has been cleaned up, improved for speed, and moved to a separate module. PRs #933 and #966 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* The separate tracking initialisation routines for thick and thin tracking have now been merged into one routine in a dedicated tracking module. PR #977 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

### Version 5.3.3 [09.09.2019] - Release

**Bug Fixes**

* Fixed bug in the `DIST` module with conversion of longitudinal emittance from eVs to µm. The conversion was off by a factor `1e6` due to the energy variable being in `MeV` not `eV`. PR #950 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* Fixed bug in the `DIST` module where emittance was sent to `DISTLIB` as normalised emittance, while `DISTLIB` expected geometric emittance. PR #952 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* Fixed a bug in binary particle state files where the internal normalisation matrix was written to file instead of the ones which have all elements scaled to the same unit. PR #952 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

**Documentation**

* Minor changes to the documentation (LaTeX manual and markdown files) to correct outdated information. PR #948 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* Updated the README to add a paper that can be cited by studies using SixTrack 5. PR #949 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen, R. De Maria)

**Code Improvements and Changes**

* The way SixTrack keeps track of particle pairs for DA studies has changed. Earlier, the pairing was preserved by a reverse map from original particle index to the current index. The index of a particle changes when it is lost in an aperture, collimator or interaction point. The reverse map was effectively a record of the particle ID. However, since the new `DIST` module makes it possible to set the particle ID to any value, the reverse map has now been replaced by a map containing a particle pairID as well as whether it is particle 1 or 2 of the pair. This map is not under the user's control, and therefore preserves the pair structure through tracking. Rewriting the code to use this map eliminates a potential memory access violation due to a corner case when particles are lost and initiated with a non-incremental particle ID. The rewrite is otherwise identical to old functionality, and shouldn't alter any results. The main benefit is cleaner code, and the particle ID now being entirely passthrough as far as SixTrack is concerned, making it easier to interface with external codes that inject new particles into SixTrack. PR #938 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen, A. Mereghetti)
* Added a check in the parsing of multi-column `STRUCT` input blocks that ensures that the element position of a given lattice element has a position larger or equal to the previous element. This prevents the accidental initialisation of negative length elements. PR #955 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* Moved a number of subroutines related to initialisation of beam--beam elements and elements in general out of the main `sixtrack` source file and to more appropriate files. PRs #957 and #960 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

### Version 5.3.2 [23.08.2019] - Release

**Bug Fixes**

* Fixed a bug with `DUMP` format 101 when using HDF5 output. The memory map used was mixed up with the map for format 3. PR #937 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* Fixed a bug in the `DIST` block module where reading less than all particles of a file would fail. PR #939 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* Fixed an issue where calculating PDGID would overflow due to intermediate integer variables being 16 bit. PR #940 (J. Molson)
* Fixed a bug with saving int16 ion variables to HDF5 files. PR #942 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

**Documentation**

* Added full documentation of the new and improved `DIST` block. PR #941 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

**Code Improvements and Changes**

* General particle transport for FLUKA and changing FLUKAIO to a submodule pulled from the GitLab repository (requires CERN Kerberos access). PR #919 (J. Molson)
* The submodule for libArchive, and its interface and wrapper code, has been removed. PR #920 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* Clean-up of the formatting of the header in a number of output files in the aperture module. PR #923 (J. Molson)
* The arrays for the per-element normalisation matrix is now no longer sparse, but instead using a compact array of structs. This reduces the memory usage of SixTrack by up to about 35%. PRs #934 and #935 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* The linear optics subroutines have been moved the a new module together with the parsing of the `LINEAR OPTICS` input block. PR #936 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

**Test Suite**

* Removed unused and incomplete test `thick6dsingles` and duplicate test `thick4in_da` as well as a lot of comments in the code used as "version control". PR #944 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

### Version 5.3.1 [02.08.2019] - Release

**Bug Fixes**

* Fixed and issue when using the collimation module with a thin 4D simulation. In this setup, the module would not be properly initialised due to an erroneous if-condition for the initialisation call. PR #931 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* Fixed a minor issue with the formatting of the tracking progress printout. PR #925 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* Fixed and issue with missing labels in aperture losses file. PR #928, issue #926 (A. Gorzawski, A. Mereghetti)

**Documentation**

* Some inconsistencies and out-of-date information has been corrected in the user manual. PRs #921, #922 and #927 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen, R. De Maria)

**Code Improvements and Changes**

* The `DIST` block has been rewritten and a number of new parsing options added for integrating with a new external library for generating beam distributions. The library is not yet completed, so the new block format is not finalised or documented. However, the `DIST` block is backwards compatible with the old options, and should be working as before. PRs #905 and #930 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen, T. Persson)
* Particle spin arrays have been added to SixTrack intended for future code, but not yet in use. The arrays have been added nonetheless so they can be included in the new `DIST` block. PR #916 (J. Molson)

### Version 5.3.0 [11.07.2019] - Release

**Bug Fixes**

* The Fortran `.eqv.` operator has a lower precedence than `.eq.`. This was not accounted for in the `SETTINGS` block when the particle summary output after tracking is requested. PR #902 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen, A. Mereghetti)
* Fixed an issue where the wrong index value was written to the `fort.208` file used in the FLUKA coupling, making the file useless. PR #911 (A. Gorzawski, A. Mereghetti)

**User Side Changes**

* A new Collimation Database file format is now supported by the Collimation module. The new format is column-wise as opposed to the old single column file. The old database is converted for the user to the new format and written to a file with the same name as the old database but `.new` added to it. The new format is in preparation for adding new collimator types to the database. PR #903 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen, A. Mereghetti)
* A Geant4 block `GNT4` has been added in order to use Geant4 with the collimation module. The features are enabled by building with the `G4COLLIMATION` flag. PR #713 (J. Molson, A. Mereghetti, K. Sjobak)
* SixTrack can now track any particle with a charge. The charge setting that exists in the `SIMU` block, and has been added to the `HION` block, now properly separates the particle charge from the ion Z value. PR #713 (J. Molson, A. Mereghetti, K. Sjobak)

**Build System**

* Fixes to ARM and OSX builds. PR #901 (J. Molson)
* Removed the .exe in the middle of the file name when building on Windows. PR #900 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* The `ZLIB` flag is now on by default, meaning the `ZIPF` block also works by default. PR #899 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* The NAFFlib submodule is updated by default during build if the user has git installed. PR #899 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* Some minor tweaks to the build system were made to support AVX-512. Seems to work best when building with Intel's Fortran compiler. PR #898 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

**Code Improvements and Changes**

* The `FAST` compiler flag and code has been removed. PR #914 (R. De Maria)
* The collimation beam distribution generator has been moved to a separate module named `coll_dist` and undergone a significant cleanup. A number of now redundant particle arrays have been removed in the process. PR #885 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

### Version 5.2.10 [13.06.2019] - Release

**Bug Fixes**

* Technically not a bug, but the Chromaticity Corrections (`CHRO`) block did not have proper checks on the validity of the settings in the input block. It never reported on the non-existence of the elements requested (although there are checks later on in SixTrack) and if the `ichrom` flag was set to an invalid value, it was simply set to a valid value without telling the user. These issues have now been corrected. It may cause previously accepted input files with faulty parameters to now fail. PR #894 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

**User Side Changes**

* Added `ZLIB` as a build option, which now includes a much simpler zipping library than libArchive. The `ZLIB` flag is off by default, but when enabled, will allow the user to use the `ZIPF` module to add simulation files to a zip file. The `ZIPF` module has also been improved a bit, and the output file can be specified as well as the compression level. In the near future, libArchive will be removed, and `ZLIB` enabled by default. PR #882 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* Rotations (also known as patches) have been implemented as new elements. It is following the same logic as MAD-X, and the conversion from MAD-X is already in the master branch. PR #892 (T. Persson)
* The particle state files that can be dumped before and after tracking now include the charge column if ions are enabled. The file also includes additional values in the header covering the settings for the reference particle, the 4D and 6D closed orbit, the tunes, and the 6-by-6 TA matrix (eigenvector/normalisation matrix). PRs #893, #895 and #896 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen, R. De Maria)

**Build System**

* Removed the `API` build flag for building the BOINC API. Building without it would previously build a dummy API for BOINC. There is no longer any apparent reason to do this as the rewrite of checkpoint/restart ensures that the tests can run fine with the full API linked. The API is now always linked when the `BOINC` flag is enabled. PR #890 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

### Version 5.2.9 [05.06.2019] - Release

**Bug Fixes**

* Added a check that the `BEAM` block is present when beam--beam elements exist in the lattice. This would previously run, but produce NaN particle coordinates due to division by zero. Thanks to Sofia Kostoglou for the example job. PR #887 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen, R. De Maria)
* Fixed a minor issue with the MD5 interface when running on Windows where the return from `fwrite` was treated as an error value. This resulted in an error message being printed for each line of the hashed file for no reason at all. PR #886 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

**User Side Changes**

* The Collimation Module now allows for name/value format to be used in the `COLL` block in `fort.3`. The full description of the formatting of the block is available in the user manual. The old format is still supported, but they cannot be mixed. PR #796 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

**Code Improvements and Changes**

* The timing module `mod_time` is now fully checkpointed, meaning the timing data in the log file `sim_time.dat` contains the correct timing information for the full simulation across multiple checkpoints and restarts. PR #884 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

**Build System**

* Solaris build support in the BOINC build script hs been added. PR #888 (J. Molson)


### Version 5.2.8 [28.05.2019] - Release

**Bug Fixes**

* Fixed a bug in the routine that inserts structure elements into the lattice. The routine uses a circular shift to cycle a fresh element (added at the end of the lattice structure by memory allocation) into the new position, but was cycling the wrong way. The result was that if the shift was over more than 2 elements, the order of the lattice would be wrong. Bug experienced when inserting the aperture markers downstream of Fluka insertions or of the lattice edges. PR #879 (A. Mereghetti)
* Fixed an error message in `DUMP` that would segfault due to using the wrong index variable in an array lookup. PR #879 (A. Mereghetti)
* Fixed a bug in the Fluka-SixTrack coupling when SixTrack errors while the beam is on the Fluka side. Solved with a temporary call to `kernel_fluka_exit` at `prror`. This required to change the interface of the `kernel_fluka_exit` subroutine. PR #879 (A. Mereghetti)
* Fixed checkpointing of statistical scaling arrays in the Scatter Module. These were previously not checkpointed at all. PR #880 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* Fixed a bug in the SixTestWrapper where not passing any checks at all would default the SixTestWrapper to pass the test as a whole. It now properly requires at least one check to be considered passed. Previously, one of the tests would always pass without verifying a single output file. PR #881 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

**BOINC Integration**

* The dummy API has been replaced by a BOINC service module. PR #875 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen, A. Mereghetti)
  * When running on BOINC, SixTrack no longer checkpoints at the turn interval specified in `fort.3`, but instead tries to checkpoint once a minute. The volunteer's setting on minimum checkpoint interval in their BOINC Manager is still obeyed.
  * When BOINC is run in standalone mode, that is in the test suite rather than by a volunteer, the checkpoint interval is 10 seconds. The settings for the `CRKILLSWITCH` are still obeyed.
  * For the time being, at least, the checkpointing decisions taken by the service module are logged to the file `cr_boinc.log`. This log file may be removed when the new scheme is properly tested.
* The BOINC library is now built from a point on the upstream master branch after some modifications to the Fortran API were merged. This means that we are running off-tag on the BOINC API, which now reports version 7.15. PR #877 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* Tracking progress reported to BOINC now stops at 99%, and the remaining 1% is reserved for post-processing. PR #877 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

**Code Improvements and Changes**

* Cleanup in the FLUKA integration modules, merging them to a single module. At the same time, refactored code for checking integrity of user info concerning coupling. Also added state variables concerning the current fluka insertion and the last messages sent/received, in view of a thorough revision of the error handling. PR #879 (A. Mereghetti)

### Version 5.2.7 [17.05.2019] - Release

**Bug Fixes**

* Fixed an infinite loop corner case from previous release. It was only triggered if one tried to rum the Differential Algebra (DA) version of SixTrack with checkpoint/restarting, which isn't something that makes sense doing anyway. The loop was only triggered with ifort builds, and used all available memory when triggered, so it was a bit nasty. In addition, the DA executable is no longer built when building with checkpoint/restart. PR #871 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

**User Side Changes**

* A new block has been added to `fort.3`. It's named `SIMU`, and holds the main tracking variables for setting up a simulations. When used, it replaces the `TRAC`, `INIT`, and `HION` block. It is intended to work with the `DIST` block, and therefore does not support any of the settings for generating distributions. If those are needed, please use the old blocks. For further details, see the user manual. The block is considered experimental until it's thoroughly tested. PR #872 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen, R. De Maria, A. Mereghetti)

**Documentation**

* Fixed the RF-multipole definitions. PR #869 (R. De Maria)

**Code Improvements and Changes**

* Removed the thick arrays: `ekv`, `fokqv` and removed the checkpointing of all remaining thick arrays. These are recomputed by the subroutine `synuthck` anyway. PR #870 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen, K. Sjobak)
* Some cleanup in the main common module for particle arrays. Mostly added comments on what variables do, and removed a few unused or redundant arrays. The deleted arrays are: `xsv`, `zsv`, `dp0v`, `sigmv6`, `dpsv6`, `xlv`, `zlv`, `nms`, and `ekkv`. PR #874 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

### Version 5.2.6 [07.05.2019] - Release

**Bug Fixes**

* Fixed a bug with linking zlib and libarchive when building on Windows. PR #853 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* Fixed a bug in postprocessing where the binary postprocessing summary file would append its data to another file in some cases. This was caused by the file having a fixed file unit in the range which is otherwise reserved for dynamically allocated file units. This file now also gets a unit assigned to it, avoiding this issue. Some checks have been added to the file units module to try and prevent similar bugs in the future. PR #855 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* The recently added error tests failed on some operating systems due to the python wrapper not finding a symlinked include file. PR #862 (K.N Sjobak)
* Fixed a floating point exception and array bounds violation in the fringe field module. PR #866 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* Fixed a bug where sometimes a segfault would be triggered when SixTrack exited with an error due to the error routine itself missing an explicit interface. PR #866 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen, K. Sjobak)

**User Side Changes**

* All the checkpoint/restart files have now been given more descriptive names with a `cr` prefix. The log file, formerly `fort.93`, has been renamed `cr_status.log`. The output to the log file has also been cleaned up significantly so that it is now more readable. PR #854 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* The `numlmax` parameter in the `TRAC` block of `fort.3` has been removed. The feature was either not fully implemented as described, or has been broken at some point. The option to use checkpoint/restart files to extend earlier simulations will be reimplemented at a later point. PR #854 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

**Code Improvements and Changes**

* When running SixTrack with BOINC, checkpoint files are written on turn 1 without requesting permission from the BOINC api. This ensures that the tests that require a successful restart to pass also pass on executables with the BOINC api linked. PR #853 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* Rewritten the checkpoint/restart module and cleaned out all code duplication. It should now be a lot easier to read the code and extend it. PR #854 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

### Version 5.2.5 [26.04.2019] - Release

**User Side Changes**

* It is now allowed to set `R1=0.0` for both elenses and chebyshev maps, even though the fox implementation is still on-going. This will allow for running full elens studies, even though the closed orbit does not take into account these elements yet. PR #850 (A. Mereghetti)
* The main SixTrack executable will now print version information and exit if provided with one of the arguments `-v`, `-V` or `-nv`. Representing two levels of detail, and the numerical version number, respectively. PR #846 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* Alternative file names for the `fort.3` and `fort.2` input files can be given as first and second argument, respectively. PR #846 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

**Bug Fixes**

* Setting the `TRAC` block variable `imc` to anything other than 1 now properly triggers an error. This is now consistent with the manual, which states "Number of variations of the relative momentum deviation has been removed. This value must be 1." PRs #847 and #848 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* The wrapper for CRLIBM had its own set of parameters `pi` and `pi2`. The wrapper now uses the new hex constants defined in `numerical_constants`. PR #845 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen, Eric Mcintosh)

**Test Suite**

* Added a new test category that checks error messages when SixTrack is made to fail by providing invalid input files. This bot increases code coverage, and ensures that faulty simulation input is caught and reported correctly. PRs #825, #847, #848 and #851 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen, K. Sjobak)

### Version 5.2.4 [23.04.2019] - Release

**User Side Changes**

* Error messages are now written to `stderr` rather than `stdout`. When building with checkpoint/restart, this is piped to `fort.91`. PR #834 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* The tracking progress output to `stdout` now also contains info about how many particles are being tracked. This is useful in simulations with particle losses. This information was previously only printed by the collimation module. PR #836 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

**Bug Fixes**

* Minor inconsistency in the writing of the `initial_state.bin` and `final_state.bin` files between compilers as logical values are stored differently. This is now set explicitly for logical values. PR #832 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* Electron lenses/chebyshev lenses flagged in `fort.2`, but not declared as such in `fort.3`, were caught only in case the respective blocks were active, The consistency check was applied in the wrong stage of parsing, and would therefore not necessarily catch the inconsistency, causing a segfault. Fixes Issue #826. PR #833 (A. Mereghetti)

**Code Improvements and Changes**

* Removed 30 arrays used as temporary arrays for thick tracking (but was always allocated). These arrays were allocated to the number of particles, but could be replaced by scalars. This change frees up `(NPART-1)*240` bytes of memory, where `NPART` is the number of tracked particles. PR #822 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen, K. Sjobak)
* Some minor reordering of the logic in handling RF cavities when below transition energy. The initialisation of the cavity elements is now in one place only. An integer array with the length of the single element list (`NELE`) was also removed. Tests have been added for below transition energy tracking. PR #828 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen, K. Sjobak)
* Commented out and no longer maintained code under the `DEBUG` flag has been deleted in coordination with Eric McIntosh. PR #835 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen, K. Sjobak)
* The constants `pi`, `pi/2`, `2*pi`, `sqrt(pi)`, `pi/180`, and `1/ln(2)` are now set with hex values to bypass conversion from decimal to binary. This is enabled for single and double precision, and for quad precision for the GNU compiler only. Intel and NAG does not support this for quad precision. PRs #840 and #842 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

### Version 5.2.3 [13.04.2019] - Release

**Bug Fixes**

* Fixed a bug in collimation where the delta_p and momentum of particle distributions generated by the collimation module were not properly recalculated from the energy. Only the first particle was handled, and the rest retained the values from the distribution generated from the `TRAC`/`INIT` blocks. The bug originated in version 5.0.3. PR #818 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen, A. Mereghetti)
* Fixed a bug where a negative kz of -12 (cavity element when below transition energy) was not converted to positive value if the print flag was off. Neither was the phase converted to radians. The conversion was embedded in a loop otherwise used for printing the lattice. PR #823 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* Fixed a bug in the SixTestWrapper in release 5.2.2 where extra checks would always be marked as passed. PR #818 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

**Code Improvements and Changes**

* The collimator database has been moved to a new module `coll_db`. This is in preparation for moving to a new and more flexible collimator database format. PR #792 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen, A. Mereghetti)

### Version 5.2.2 [08.04.2019] - Release

**User Side Changes**

* Support for variations of momentum offset in the `INIT` block has been removed. This feature has not been maintained for a long time, and was incompatible with the several modules of SixTrack. It was also wasteful in terms of memory usage. Since SixTrack accepts input distributions from file, the feature is also redundant. We therefore decided to remove it rather than bringing it up to speed with the rest of the code. This change fixes the `imc` flag to a value of 1 (7th value on line 1 of the `INIT` block). Any other value will cause an error. This change frees up `(NPART-1)*680` bytes of memory, where `NPART` is the number of tracked particles. PR #804 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

**Test Suite**

* The output of the wrapper executable for the test suite has been made a bit more readable. This is visible when ctest is run with the `-V` flag. PR #807 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

### Version 5.2.1 [05.04.2019] - Release

**New Features**

* The Structure Block in `fort.2` is now also available in a multicolumn format. This mode is switched on by specifying `MULTICOL` on the first line. The column format consists of a minimum of 3 columns. The first being the proper element name as used in MadX, the second column is the Single Element name (corresponding to the single column format), and the third one is the element position as described in MadX (the s-coordinate of the centre of the element). A `multicol` flag has also been added to the SixTrack converter in MadX, and will be available in the next release of MadX following version 5.04.02. The new format is currently only implemented in the aperture losses file to list the proper element name for lost particles. PR #799 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* A module for quadrupole fringe fields has been added to SixTrack, and added as an `FFIE` block in `fort.3`. This method allows for the usage of a longitudinal description of the quadrupole magnetic field, adapted for each magnet specifically selected for the study, without changing the reference optics of SixTrack. PR #776 (T. Pugnat, B. Dalena)

**User Side Changes**

* The `PRINT_DCUM` flag in the `SETTINGS` block that printed the full lattice with s-coordinates to stdout is now instead written to a file named `machine_length.dat`. The file now also prints the information from the multicolumn lattice description in the Structure Block, and compares the computed position `dcum` with the one read from MadX. The delta in nanometres is listed. PR #799 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

**Bug Fixes**

* Fixed a bug in `plato_seq.f90` where the comment states in `tuneffti` that it will not accept frequency indices of 0 or 1, but does anyway and returns a value NaN. This causes a segfault on Debug type builds. The routine now returns one instead in these cases. A similar fix was applied to `tunebt2`. PR #803 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* Removed two `close(6)` calls in `abend` that caused an abort with BOINC when building with nagfor. PR #803 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

### Version 5.2 [27.03.2019] - Release

**New Features**

* The SCATTER module has been completely rewritten to better allow for adding multiple scattering processes (generators) to scatter elements. It does this by computing branching ratios either from provided cross sections, or by fixed values. PR #670 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* SixTrack can now integrate with PYTHIA to generate scattering events for the SCATTER module. Currently only head on events at a single centre of mass energy are generated. This will be extended further in the future. It is, however, possible to extract elastic and diffractive events, with and without particle losses. PR #670 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* The `FINALSTATE` and `INITIALSTATE` flags in the `SETTINGS` block now take `ions` as a second keyword, enabling the dumping of the ion columns in addition to the main particle arrays. PR #777 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

**User Side Changes**

* When reading `fort.13` the particle energy is used to set the momentum and delta_p arrays instead of the delta_p overwriting energy and momentum. This means the delta_p values in the file are ignored. The change was made due to the intended usage of `fort.13` being continuation of tracking, not initialisation of particles. During tracking only energy should be changed, and the other dependent variables calculated from the energy arrays. PR #766 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* The trombone and beam--beam elements now use the updateEnergy routine from `mod_particles` as well to recompute the energy-dependant arrays. The change in beam--beam slightly alters output due to the previous code using a different way of calculating one of the values. PRs #786 and #795 (T. Persson)

**Bug Fixes**

* The module handling opening and closing of files wrote warnings to stderr. This is now written to stdout instead to avoid cluttering the stderr logs when running on BOINC. PR #774 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* Fixed a bug with some some of the output files under the FLUKA flag. The bug was introduced in 5.1.2. PR #780 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* Fixed some `write(unit,*)` of header files in the collimation module that produced different results on the `nagfor` compiler than the others. PR #790 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

**Code Improvements and Changes**

* Interface routines for adding attributes to HDF5 datasets have been added. PR #670 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* Longer filenames are now allowed in the `mod_units` module. The new maximum is 255 characters (Windows limit). PR #783 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* Moved the parameters derived from pi `twopi`, `pi2`, `rad`, and `pisqrt` to module `numerical_constants`. PR #785 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* Added echo on STDOUT of calls to `contour_aperture_marker` and `contour_aperture_markers` subroutines and respective header, improved dump of aperture markers and header now fully aligned to dumped table, improved readability of messages on STDOUT from `contour_aperture_marker`, and added a function that checks that the lattice structure does not start inside a `FLUKA` insertion. PR #789 (A. Mereghetti)

**Documentation**

* Fixed an issue in the documentation of `DYNK` where a table was split in two. PR #782 (T. Persson)

**Build System and Test Suite**

* Added a `MOSYMLINK` flag to CMake that makes the test suite copy the input files to the build folder rather than symlink on Unix environments. PR #781 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* Some minor cleanup CMake, including the way version numbers are handled. PR #788 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* Disabled collimation tests when checkpoint/restart is active. PR #791 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

### Version 5.1.3 [25.01.2019] - BOINC Release

**User Side Changes**

* Misalignment of RF-multipoles is now possible. PR #763 (T. Persson)

**Bug Fixes**

* Aperture checking along a transition takes into account RACETRACK properly. PR #771 (A. Mereghetti)
* When built with checkpoint/restart, the `mod_units` would try to write to the `file_units.log` file after it was closed. This caused SixTrack to exit with an error code after tracking when building with the NAG compiler. PR #770 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

**Documentation**

* Build scripts for HTML version of the manual have been fixed. PR #767 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* Documentation on aperture limitations have been updated. PR #771 (A. Mereghetti)

**Code Improvements and Changes**

* The old `comnul` subroutine used to zero out old common blocks has been reduced to almost nothing. The default values are now set in their respective modules, mainly in `common_modules.f90`. PRs #765, #768 and #771 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen, A. Mereghetti)
* Some general code clean-up of the aperture module. PR #771 (A. Mereghetti)
* Symplecticity deviation is now written to `sim_meta.dat` instead of its own file. PR #770 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* Files are no generally opened where they're needed rather than at the start of `maincr`. This helps to reduce the number of zero size fort.* files in the simulation folder. PR #770 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

### Version 5.1.2 [14.01.2019] - Release

**User Side Changes**

* The memory allocation log is now only written when SixTrack is built with the `DEBUG` flag. This file can grow fairly large, and has caused issues when running on BOINC. PR #750 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* Added the option to write a file with the initial (pre-tracking) coordinates of all particles. This is the same format as the final state files added earlier. The feature is enabled with the `INITIALSTATE` and `FINALSTATE` keywords in the `SETTINGS` block. PR #760 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* Generalised RF-Multipoles have been added to SixTrack. See manual. PR #756 (T. Persson)

**Bug Fixes**

* An allocatable array was declared and passed to `mod_alloc` per particle/turn/element in subroutine `sbc` in `beam6d.f90`. This caused the memory log file to grow very large, and likely had a performance cost. The call to `mod_alloc` has been removed. PR #749 (R. De Maria)
* Fixed an issue where the extraction of `Sixin.zip` would not trigger properly. The decision whether to call the extraction is taken on the existence of a specific file in the run folder. The file exist check didn't trigger properly with the new file open wrapper in `mod_units`. PR #751 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* When writing `fort.4` (a duplicate of `fort.2`), both files need to be opened in module `mod_fluc`. Previously `fort.2` was opened globally during init, but is now only opened when input parsing is run. An additional open call was missing in `mod_fluc`. This made the nagfor compiler very unhappy. PR #752 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* Fixed a little bug in aperture which becomes evident if `tlen` starts to deviate from `dcum(iu)`. All the calculations in aperture (especially for the backtracking algorithm) are based on `dcum`, but if the code has to deal with the beginning/end of the ring, it was using `tlen`, whereas, to be consistent, it should use `dcum(iu)`. PR #755 (A. Mereghetti)
* Fixed a bug where lines after the `LOAD` keyword in the `LIMI` block were ignored. PR #754
* Fixed a potential bug with fixed file units set in the `elens` module where the unit was within the range of those automatically assigned by `mod_units`. PR #759  (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* In a number of places in tracking, a subroutine looping over all particles was called from within a particle loop. These were moved to the outside of the loop. PR #759 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

**Code Improvements and Changes**

* The two modules handling file units have been merged to a single module. Each previous module was handling dynamic allocation of file unit and wrapping the open statement for compiler options separately. The new module now also writes a log file listing all files opened and closed through the module. PR #747 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)
* The parsing of the aperture limitations file in the `LIMI` block has been updated and made more consistent with how other secondary input files are handled elsewhere in SixTrack. This simplifies the code. PR #754 (A. Mereghetti)
* No-longer used particle array size variables in the collimation code were cleaned up. PR #665 (K. Sjobak)
* The cavities now call the `part_updatePartEnergy` routine after changing particle energy. The subroutine now also optionally computes the change in particle angle. PR #759 (V.K. Berglyd Olsen)

### Version 5.1.1 [13.12.2018] - BOINC Release

**BOINC Specific Changes**

* Updated to use BOINC lib and API 7.14.2.

**Known Issues**

* BOINC with API does not run properly when built on latest Ubuntu LTS and Debian when both the BOINC API and SixTrack is built with the Gnu compiler. Mixing gcc and ifort or nagfor runs fine. This does not seem to be an issue when building on Fedora and CentOS. The Linux executables provided for this release are built on CentOS 7.

**Test Suite**

* A test can now be configured to automaticall stop on certain turn numbers using the `CRKILLSWITCH` flag in the `SETTINGS` block. This will help ensuring that tests actually restart from checkpoint data.
* The test suite can now verify that specified tests actually do restart when building with checkpoint/restart support.

### Version 5.1.0 [11.12.2018] - Release

While this release includes regular bug fixes and changes, the primary focus is on making code improvements that allows for a wider range of studies to be run on BOINC.

**BOINC Specific Changes**

* The elens module is now compatible with BOINC, meaning that it is properly checkpointed and the output files are properly wrapped for use with BOINC.
* The aperture module is now compatible with BOINC, meaning that it is properly checkpointed and the output files are properly wrapped for use with BOINC.

**Input File Format Changes**

* The input parser now enforces the use of a `NEXT` flag after the `PRINT` block. That is, the block must be properly closed like all other input blocks. The fact that such a flag has not been required in the past is due to a loophole in the old input parsing code. Note that usage of the `PRINT` block is deprecated. The same functionality is achieved by specifying a `PRINT` command in the `SETTINGS` block. The `PRINT` block will be removed in a future release.
* The format of aperture input information (`LIMI` block) has been changed, breaking compatibility with previous versions. In particular, tilt angle is now set as last column, as implemented by MADX-to-SixTrack converter, instead of being last but two. Moreover, the aperture offset is not expressed in terms of local value of the survey but as actual offset; hence, offset values are subtracted from particle coordinates and not summed when the aperture is checked. All users of the Fluka-SixTrack coupling will have to update their aperture model - the change in the pre-processing script to do so will come shortly.

**Other User Side Changes**

* Added a `FINALSTATE` flag in the `SETTINGS` block in `fort.3` that writes a binary or text file (via roundctl) of all particles at the end of tracking (but before post-processing). The flag takes `binary` or `text` as an option, specifying the file format. The `final_state.dat` or `final_state.bin` file produced also contains the particles flagged as lost during tracking.
* Added a `HASH` module that can be used for computing the md5sum of output files. The primary purpose of this is for checking that the output is consistent in the test suite or when results are returned from BOINC.
* Increased information in the error message produced when an error is encountered in the parsing of the `fort.3` input file.
* E-lens module can now handle a radial profile read from text file.
* E-lens kick are now fully chromatic.
* E-lens current and kinetic energy can be modified during tracking via `DYNK`.

**Build System**

* The build system now requires CMake 3.2; up from 3.0.

**Bug Fixes**

* Minor bug in parsing of the `ELENS` input block where specifying a non-existent element would trigger the wrong error message to be returned.
* Fixes a bug in checkpoint/restarting where `DUMP` restart information was not written to the secondary checkpoint file.
* Fixed a bug in checkpoint/restarting where an infinite loop might occur when both primary and secondary checkpoint files were corrupt.
* Checkpoint/restarting did not work as expected when building with the nagfor compiler. This compiler is more strict than gfortran and ifort on how files are accessed, which caused a nagfor built executable to try to overwrite `fort.10` with a dummy file even if it existed.
* Fixed a bug in beam--beam in the case of the `ibeco` flag being set to 0. In this case the beam offset would be computed with uninitialised variables.

**Code Improvements and Changes**

* All open file units registered in the module `mod_units` and `file_units` are now flushed after post-processing, and before the `HASH` and `ZIPF` modules are called.

**Test Suite**

* The `Sixin.zip` files used for testing BOINC builds have been removed from the repository. These are now generated when needed by the test suite CMake.

### Version 5.0.3 [22.11.2018] - Release

**Bug Fixes**

* Due to inconsistent if-statements, FMA would sometimes write to a non-existent file unit without opening the file properly.
* DYNK would not build with nagfor due to two malformed strings.
* Fixed building with `ROUND_ZERO` flag. The `matlib_bouncer` was trying to call non-existent round-towards-zero routines for `exp_mb()` functions (which is handled by round down `exp_rd()`), and `log10_mb` which was missing for `ROUND_ZERO` and has been added to `CRLIBM`.
* A variable for DYNK FIR/IIR functions was written to memory twice, but with an invalid index for one of those writes. This write has been removed.
* Removed a remaining `COLLIMAT` flag in the beam-gas module that prevented the `BEAMGAS` flag from building.
* Fixed an infinite loop bug in Checkpoint/Restart where the restart would repeatedly try to open `fort.96` if the reading failed while reading DUMP checkpoint data. This would only occur if both `fort.95` and `fort.96` files were corrupt.
* Fixed a bug where ifort would not accept `180_fPrec` as a valid floating point number in the `aperture` module.
* Removed references to intrinsic `ieee_arithmetic` due to significant performance loss when building with gfortran.
* The particle array `dpsv1` was wrongly updated in various parts of SixTrack. This has now been corrected. The error only affected ion tracking, but not protons.
* Previous fix to trombone elements in v5.0.1 was only for thin tracking. The same fix has now been applied to thick tracking.
* Loading beam population with the `DIST` block did not update all energy/momentum arrays correctly on initialisation. This is now fixed. The change is very small.

**User Side Changes**

* Electron lenses have been re-enabled, and the code reverted/rewritten to produce the same results as for SixTrack 4.7.18. Further updates will be made.
* The FMA output files will no longer contain NaN values. The NaN values were deliberate return values for `atan2(0,0)` call. This behaviour has been changed to return `0d0` instead, following [IEEE Std 1003.1-2017 (Revision of IEEE Std 1003.1-2008)](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/). The nagfor compiler does not comply with this standard, and the return value for the nagfor built executables is handled by an additional if statement.
* Added DYNK support for coupled 4D beam-beam elements.
* Introduced consistent settings of coupling in the strong beam for 4D.
* A new output file, `sim_meta.dat`, has been added. The file lists name value pairs of information about the last run simulation.
* A new output file, `sim_time.dat`, has been added. The file lists time stamps throughout the simulation in key points, as well as compute cpu time averages.
* Parsing of beam distribution file `fort.13` has been updated. The energy per particle value read from the file is ignored and computed from the delta_p (`dpsv`) value provided.
* The `DIST` block has been updated to use the `CRLIBM` rounding library.
* The Collimation module now accepts dist format 0, which bypasses the internal beam distribution generator and instead uses the one defined by the `INIT` or `DIST` block.

**Build System**

* Added a `defaultBuild.sh` script that builds SixTrack with NAFF and libArchive support.
* The `buildLibraries.sh` script has been split up and rewritten to support more libraries. The script can be called with no arguments to build all libraries, or with `boinc`, `libarchive` or `hdf5` to build the respective libraries only. Dependencies are handled automatically.
* Building with flags `G4COLLIMAT`, `BEAMGAS` and `MERLINSCATTER` now disables building of the Differential Algebra executable (SixDA).
* The first 7 characters of the git hash is now added to the executable name as part of the version number.
* Added symlink name `sixtrack` pointing to the SixTrack executable in the build directory.
* Changed the way lquadmath is linked on Mac to make it more robust.

**Other Changes**

* A set of developer tools for MAD-X/SixTrack output testing and comparison has been added in the `devtools` folder.
* The standard output from SixTrack has been cleaned up and tweaked a little.

**Code Improvements and Changes**

* A new subroutine for initialising the random number generator has been added. This routine has proper boundary checks on the seeds. It can also optionally accept one seed. instead of two. The second seed is then calculated by a fixed offset.
* The internal NAFF library has been replaced by a rewritten external library now included as a submodule.
* Remaining code for multiple machines (different random seeds) has bean cleaned out. The feature was already disabled.
* Aperture checks have been inlined to improve performance.

### Version 5.0.2 [23.08.2018] - Release

**Bug Fixes**

* Fixed bug where the Solenoid element would use the energy of the previous turn for computations.

### Version 5.0.1 [22.08.2018] - Release

**User Side Changes**

* DUMP now uses the roundctl library when writing float values (except for the s coordinate). This fixes the failing test(s) where some values are printed as -0.0E0. This ensures that the output is consitent across compilers and platforms.
* Added DUMP format 101 for as a debugging dump format.
* MULTIPOLES now consider the curvature effect when there is a quadrupolar field in the dipole (element 11). This is mainly useful to model combined function magnets.
* Added new "debugging" format to DUMP, format 101.
* Updated DUMP manual and headers for consistency.
* COLLIMAT compilation flag removed. The collimation code is always compiled, and is controlled by the `COLL` block in `fort.3`.
* Fixes to phase trombone implementation.
* FMA is now using `atan2` in stead of `atan` to get the phase.
* ABS function added to DYNK.
* Flag `ibidu` and file `fort.32` was removed.
* Improved error reporting and consistency throughout the code.
* SixTrack output header updated, adding including GIT hash and key build flags. Timing report at the end of execution also improved.

**Documentation**

* Collimation was added to manual.
* HDF5 module was documented.

**Code Improvements and Changes**

* The old fixed length getfields_split routine has been removed entirely from the source. It is replaced by `chr_split` from the `string_tools` module.
* All remaining usage of zero chars have has been removed from the source. Zero-terminated strings should now be handled by interface routines for c. The fixed length `stringzerotrim` routine has been removed, but the variable length chr_trimZero remains in case it is needed in the future.
* Collimation arrays only allocated when COLL block is present. When present, memory use is significantly increased (as before).
* Particles and energy update codes centralized in new module `mod_particles`.
* Some NaNs are now quiet.
* SixTrack no longer exits on underflow when compiled with build type `debug`.
* Libraries boinc, libarchive, and zlib were moved from `source` to `lib`.
* Consolidated `alloc`/`resize` calls and removed redundant interface `resize` from `mod_alloc`.
* Updated `DYNK`, `FMA`, `ZIPF`, and `ROOT` blocks to use the new string split routines. 
* New flexible wrapping system `chr_fromReal()` for converting floating point numbers to strings. Added to `DUMP`, making the DUMP outputs consistent between compilers.

**Tests**

* Added tests for nearly all of the DYNK FUN statements. Only PELP, PIPE, and FIR are currently untested.
* The old SixTest test harness was finally deleted, and the `test` folder was cleaned up.
* Updated canonicals for `prob1` / `prob3`, `fma*`, `dump*`. All tests except `*elens*` should now work.
* Added test that the user manual builds correctly.
* Continuous integration (CI) was added.

**Bug Fixes**

* MULT block with non-existent single element now causes an error instead of writing the coefficients to invalid memory.
* Fixed write-to-outside-an-array error in `track_thin`.

### Version 5.0 RC3 [12.07.2018] - Release Candidate

**User Side Changes**

* All flags related to scaling of particle and element arrays have been removed. All these arrays now scale dynamically. The related compiler flags have been removed. that is: BIGNPART, HUGENPART, BIGNBLZ, HUGENBLZ.
* Major updates to the build system. Both versions of SixTrack (DA and non-DA) executables are now built, and the test folders have been merged.
* Major changes to collimation and aperture losses. Fixes a number of issues. Results will be different due to improved precision.
* Completely rewritten input parsing. General changes are:
  * Allows for blank lines and in-line comments starting with `!`
  * Allows for indented block content. Block name and NEXT still has to start at the beginning of the line.
  * Full support for single and double quoted strings.
  * Note that the parser is now stricter on blocks being properly closed and not repeated (unless repetition of blocks is specifically suported, see the manual.)
* Solenoid code has been fixed.
* Fixes to HDF5 and ROOT file output.
* New SETTINGS block where the PRINT flag has been moved, and where a QUIET flag has been added. The QUIET flag takes an integer number from 0 to 3 that reduces the amount of output generated. A global DEBUG flag has also been added that will cause te input parser to echo back parsed values.
* Major cleanup of runtime output in general.

**Code Improvements and Changes**

* The custom astuce pre-processor has been removed and everything is now handled by the C pre-processor. This implies that:
  * Includes are now handled by `#include` statements and the files are located in the include folder. `+cd` blocks are gone.
  * Nearly all common blocks have been removed and the variables moved into modules.
* Renamed the folders `SixTrack` to `source` and `SixTest` and `SixTest_da` to `test`.
* Major cleanup of the source and test folders, and the build target directory is now outside the source folder.
* Major restructuring of the source code. Mainly the splitting up of old `sixtrack.s` file into sensible files and converted to modules when reasonable.
* Started using mod_alloc also for internal subroutine/module arrays. This helps tracking memory usage.
* Added a completely new string split routine, and started phasing out both the old ones. The new routine uses dynamic array allocation and therefore have no strict limits to size and number of elements.
* Completely rewritten subroutine daten. All blocks are now parsed line by line in a single fort.2/fort.3 loop. Lines are either parsed in the module corresponding to the given block, or in a separate subroutine in the new module sixtrack_input. Diagnostics and debug routines have been added.
* Opening of standard SixTrack I/O files are now handled by module mod_units. This is different from the dynamically assigned file units module as these are fixed units with compiler flags for FIO, CRLIBM and BOINC handled internally. This removes the need to specifiy open calls for each set of flags every time a file is opened.
* Wrapper for converting strings to real(32/64/128), presenting one user interface `chr_cast()` to the programmer, internally using different codes for CRLIBM, non-CRLIBM, and FIO. This cleanes up input reading a lot.

**Disabled or Removed Features**

* Tune-shift corrections have been removed. This also removes the need for NAGLIB.
* Electron lens is currently disabled, but is planned re-enabled before final release.
* BNLELENS and RHICELENS flags removed.

* Added optional QUIET flag that will stop SixTrack from reporting initial and final values of particle pairs.
* Fixed the previously broken DA version of the code. Still may have issues with naglib when compiled with gfortran.
* Added HDF5 block for alternative ouptut for DUMP and Scatter.
* BDEX and FLUKA was merged.

**Code Improvements and Changes**

* SixTrack is now Fortran 2008 Free Form, and depcrecated syntax has been converted or removed.
* Significant portions of the code has been split out into Fortran modules, including many common blocks.
* Abstraction of math functions: One single routine to call for each math function (sin(x) etc) which then calls the appropriate crlibm / libm method.
* SixTrack can now be compiled in single, double or quad precision.
* Partially completed:
  * Autoscaling of arrays. Will replace BIGNPART, HUGENPART, etc. flags eventually.
  * Dynamic file unit assignment.
  * ROOT/XROOTD (EOS) support. Not documented.
* Fixed:
  * Closed orbit search.
* Removed:
  * thin/thck6dua. Replacd by DYNK, see documenttaion.
  * BPM flag. Replaced by DUMP, see documentation.
* Currently broken:
  * Electron lens.
* File units can now be dynamically allocated by the file_units module.
* Added a strings tools module to do string manipulation.

**Documentation**

* Manual has been completely reformatted and restructured.
* Documentation still missing or incomplete for several modules.

The structure of the input has been chosen in order to later easily extend it also to other e-beam current distributions.
* Modifications for collimation halo studies:
  * Increased the range of the efficiency histogram vs. radial amplitude (file "efficiency.dat"), now ranging from 5-20.5 sigma.
  * Fixed radial amplitude definition used for halo studies to include also the alpha and angle.
  * Added to output files: "efficiency_dpop.dat": efficiency vs. Delta p/p to be used for off-momentum halo studies; "efficiency_2d.dat": 2D efficiency vs. radial amplitude and Delta p/p.

* General cleanup of LINOPT code.
* Remove unused arrays from collimation code.
* Detect and issue warning in case the user tries to built with crlibm + colimat; See issue #33 
* Add DYNK sanity checks during initialization.

**Bug fixes**
* Collimation: Invalid index when initializing the rvv particle array, causing potentially invalid tracking results. After fixing this, it is now possible to track up to 20'000 particles per collimation run. It also means that tracking results using collimation version may change slightly, as particle array initialization is now correct.
* LINOPT: For collimation, call WRITELIN on ALL elements, including disabled RF cavities and Crab Cavities. This fixes #8 .
* WRITELIN+CORRORB: Avoid invalid access of variable ixwl and kp() for BLOCs, which are anyway neither correctors or observation points.
* DUMP+COLLIMAT: Fix bug resulting in wrong particle indices. This fixes issue #27 .
* LINOPT: Get block names form BEZB, not BEZ.

### SixTrack Version: 4.5.26 

* Removed the two calls to boinc_zipitall

_McIntosh, 8th June, 2015_
 
### SixTrack Version: 4.5.25

* Give DYNK the capability of changing RF cavity settings. The new features are documented in the draft [SixTrack manual](https://github.com/kyrsjo/SixtrackTools/raw/master/user_manual/six.pdf) When implementing this, a bug affecting RF cavities which were present in the SINGLE ELEMENTS and STRUCTURE INPUT list of fort.2 but switched off (voltage = 0). These were *in some cases* still present in the lattice, slightly affecting the beam. This is the case for the LHC sequence (200 MHz RF system). This means that simulation results will from now on be *slightly* different.

_Kyrre, 3rd June, 2015_

### SixTrack Version: 4.5.13 Adriana

**Modifications to Collimation Routines**
* Add output file Coll_Scatter.dat (within the Jaw subroutine) with all interactions at collimators
* Add output file FLUKA_impacts_all.dat with all absorptions at collimators
* Add Single Diffractive events in FLUKA_impacts.dat
* Add Pencil Beam type 3 (R.Bruce): The new pencil beam model uses the existing routines for annular halo generation and samples a matched halo at the face or end of any given collimator, with all particles hitting the jaws at a variable depth. There is no unphysical tilt of the jaws with the beam envelope as in the previous pencil beam
* Replacement of the scattering routine with an upgraded version (C.Tambasco and B.Salvachua). At the moment the old routine is commented out, to be seen if to delete it or put it as a compilation option. The new routine includes:
  * A different Carbon density that better fits the real collimator jaw material.
  * The addition of the logarithmic term in the in the rms angle equation of the multiple Coulomb scattering has been added.
  * Implementation of the Bethe-Bloch equation (in place of a fix value) to better estimate the ionization losses.
  * Computation of new fits of experimental data (TOTEM collaboration) to better extrapolate the proton-proton elastic and total cross sections.
  * Updating of the proton-proton single diffractive cross section considering a recent parametrization based on the renormalized pomeron flux exchange.
  * Updating of the proton-nucleus inelastic and total cross sections considering the new available data from the Particle Data Group.
* Further modification to the computation of ionisation losses taking into account the tale of the Landau distribution, since Bethe-Bloch is not valid for beta.gamma>1000 (D. Mirarchi).

* Added and updated alignment errors (tilt, offset, gap-size): all values of alignment errors can be kept identical for different runs, by applying the same seed. Therefore the random function myran_gauss and rndm5 have been added and the inputs fort.3 adapted.
* Alignment errors are also applied for deformed jaws.
* Added to the pencil beam section the possibility to generate different particle distributions (Gaussian and rectangular in x and y) on the selected collimator.
* Changes to the do_select option to get the multi-turn halo information for all particle packets.

### SixTrack Version: 4.2.3 Revision 1.30 frs

* Fix the missing phase advance in the solenoid. This thin element is special in the sense that the it creates a direct phase advance that has to be calculated at every element occurrence.

* If bnlelens, use napx rather napx00/npart for number of pairs
* Most important is that bnlens option is now an addition to the normal tracking so that the SAME executable can be used for normal DA and bnlelens LHC=9 runs (important for BOINC/CPSS) but LHC=9 does NOT write binary files nor post-process.

_McIntosh 20th August, 2008_

### SixTrack Version: 4.1.7 CVS Version 1.17 McIntosh

* make_six has a new 'debug' option to aid SixTrack development.
* If debug is selected, a new flag to ASTUTE SixTrack makes  available Unit 99 for messages and dumps and a set of dump routines (of which only a full dump in this version).
* A couple of write(* in SUBRE are now handled by C/R.
* A couple of bugs with C/R and IDFOR have been fixed.
* All subsequent changes noted here are for the 'bnlelens' and other SixTrack functionality should be unchanged (except that fort.95 and 96 are used for Checkpoint/Restart, C/R, instead of 12 and 13.)
* The bnlelens option has been implemented in comdecks bnlin and bnlout principally so it works for all six tracking routines. This has been tested only for THCK6D so far. There are now no changes to trauthck and trauthin.
* The C/R option for 6d and thick lens is disabled unless debug is selected.
* C/R now handles additional variables and correctly positions the beambeam-output.dat and beambeam-lostID.dat files.
* The binary files 90-59 are not used; no post-processing is performed. All OPEN/CLOSE have been moved to the standard comdecks and the variables moved to COMMON initialised by COMNUL.
* The READDIS routine for bnlelens is renamed to BNLRDIS to avoid confusion with collimation and it uses UNIT 54 to  read beambeamdist.dat which may now have only one sample.
* The n_cut and n_nocut variables are set to zero before the j loop.

_McIntosh 18th August, 2008_

### SixTrack Version: 4.1.6 CVS Version 1.16 McIntosh

### SixTrack Version: 4.0.0

**Comments:** Includes beam collimation, checkpoint/restart, and crlib options along with major code cleanup.

**Options:** The following sub-directories, ast_crcrlib ast_crlib ast_straight ast_tilt,  contain the .ast files for building as follows: The straight/tilt builds without/with tilt. The crcrlib builds tilt with checkpoint/restart and crlib. The crlib builds tilt with crlib.

**Default:** The .ast files in the current directory are for ast_crlib on SLC3 Linux at CERN. The crlibm routines in CRLIBOBJS.a are for Linux and have been compiled with lf95 6.2 and gcc 3.2.3.

The following options are available (after copying the desired ast files to the current directory if non-default):
