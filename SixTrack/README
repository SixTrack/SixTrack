  SixTrack Version: 4.0.09
     -- removed redundant directory sixtrack and *.ast files.
   Eric 16 May 2007

     -- Program stops when single element names longer than 16 characters.
     -- Program stops when when order of multipoles in fort.3 exceed MMUL.
     -- MMUL is set to 20 for all non-collimation versions.
   FS 09 May 2007  

   Latest version of the expanded version for collimation studies (collimat flag)
     -- change of the collimator labels step to take into account the new Beam 2 lattice from MADX
     -- "STOP" flags have been checked and removed if necessary
     -- fort.XX units checked: no unit number above 99 shall be used
   GRD-SR 26/09/2006

  SixTrack Version: 4.0.08 
   Latest version of the expanded version for collimation studies (collimat flag)
     -- creation of 3 additive "makedis" subroutines, incl. one that allows to read any beam 
        distribution from a given input file
     -- correction of "bug" from previous RHIC version that added a fake aperture limitation of
        4 cm during tracking (particles over that amplitude were considered as absorbed)
     -- new treatment of collimator material: one can now simulate the flatness of any/both jaws 
        with fit parameters to be specified in the fort.3 file (COLLIMATION block)
   GRD-SR 20/10/2005

  SixTrack Version: 4.0.07 
  Version 1.3 make_six 05/09/2005 and Makefile updated
  CERNLIB only for SixTrack (not SixTrack_da); CERNGRAF dropped.
  The -naglib option now works for SixTrack_da
  Fixed problem with missing +ei in crpoint for CPSS version 

  SixTrack Version: 4.0.06
   Version 1.2 make_six 29/08/2005
   CERNLIB//GRAFLIB re-defined
   Forced lf95 for crlibm
   Added g95 option
   Redefined "our" isnan as myisnan and dropped it from crlibm
   (Should actually make a crlibm.s for crlibm with a Windows option)

  SixTrack Version: 4.0.05
   Latest version of the expanded version for collimation studies (collimat flag)
     -- creation of impact, absorption and FLUKA files
     -- correction/upgrade of writing process for halo files: trajectory written at entrance
        and exit of each collimator
     -- new treatment of RHIC lattice with possibility of playing with the 2 different apertures
        of its primary collimator

  SixTrack Version: 4.0.04 boinc bis
   Fixed a corrupted makefile and added Makefile.boinc
   Eric 2/4/2005

  SixTrack Version: 4.0.04 boinc
   Added boinc option to sixtrack.s dabnew.s
   and to make_six using myboinc.f Eric 31/3/2005

  SixTrack Version: 4.0.04 bis
   Didn't touch SixTrack at all.
   Fixed comment and bug in make_six re naglib default.
   Created directory windows for crlibm for Windows.
   Added some options for cpss/windows to generate the
   src code and crlibm using the script mkwindows and 
   added checks for options.  Eric. 22/3/2005.
 
  SixTrack Version: 4.0.04
   Fix the problem with common blocks in sixda.f.
   Fix a small bug in dafor.f 
   Minor changes to make_six and Makefile.

  SixTrack Version: 4.0.03
   Completely new make_six to make SixTrack,(default), SixTrack_da (da) with crlibm/crlibm.a,
   Cernlib and Naglib.
   Options are: tilt tracking fast crlibm windows cernlib naglib da collimat cpss boinc cr nag g77
   Defaults are: tilt tracking fast crlibm cernlib naglib
   -option to delete it e.g -cernlib
   [+]option to activate e.g +cr for Checkpoint/Restart

   Uses the ast files in ast_mask
   e.g.
   make_six (defaults to tracking tilt fast crlibm cernlib)
   make_six collimat (does the same but with collimation)
   Supported compilers are lf95 (default) or NAG f95 or g77.
   Fixed a bug with crbinrecs in writebin in sixtrack.s

  SixTrack Version: 4.0.0
   Comments: Includes beam collimation, checkpoint/restart, and
             crlib options along with major code cleanup.

   Options: The following sub-directories, 
            ast_crcrlib ast_crlib ast_straight ast_tilt,
            contain the .ast files for building as follows:
            The straight/tilt builds without/with tilt.
            The crcrlib builds tilt with checkpoint/restart and crlib.
            The crlib builds tilt with crlib.
  
   Default: The .ast files in the current directory are for ast_crlib
            on SLC3 Linux at CERN. The crlibm routines in CRLIBOBJS.a
            are for Linux and have been compiled with lf95 6.2 and gcc 3.2.3.

   The following options are available (after copying the desired ast files
   to the current directory if non-default):

   makex clean

   makex sixtrack_vector_new

   makex sixtrack_da_new
