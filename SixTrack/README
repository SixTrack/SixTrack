 SixTrack Version: 4.5.26 
    -- Removed the two calls to boinc_zipitall
   McIntosh, 8th June, 2015
 
 SixTrack Version: 4.5.25 Kyrre
    --  Give DYNK the capability of changing RF cavity
settings. The new features are documented in the draft SixTrack manual, found
at: https://github.com/kyrsjo/SixtrackTools/raw/master/user_manual/six.pdf [github.com]
When implementing this, a bug affecting RF cavities which were present in the SINGLE ELEMENTS and
STRUCTURE INPUT list of fort.2 but switched off (voltage = 0). These were *in some cases* still present
in the lattice, slightly affecting the beam. This is the case for the LHC sequence (200 MHz RF system).
This means that simulation results will from now on be *slightly* different.
   Kyrre, 3rd June, 2015

   McIntosh , 3rd May, 2014

 SixTrack Version: 4.5.13 Adriana
    Modifications to Collimation Routines
    -- Add output file Coll_Scatter.dat (within the Jaw subroutine)  
       with all interactions at collimators
    -- Add output file FLUKA_impacts_all.dat  
       with all absorptions at collimators
    -- Add Single Diffractive events in FLUKA_impacts.dat
    -- Add Pencil Beam type 3 (R.Bruce): 
       The new pencil beam model uses the existing
       routines for annular halo generation and samples a matched halo at 
       the face or end of any given collimator, with all particles hitting 
       the jaws at a variable depth. There is no unphysical tilt of the 
       jaws with the beam envelope as in the previous pencil beam
    -- Replacement of the scattering routine with an upgraded version 
       (C.Tambasco and B.Salvachua). At the moment the old routine is 
       commented out, to be seen if to delete it or put it as a compilation
       option. The new routine includes:
         A different Carbon density that better fits the real collimator 
          jaw material.
         The addition of the logarithmic term in the in the rms angle 
          equation of the multiple Coulomb scattering has been added. 
         Implementation of the Bethe-Bloch equation (in place of a fix value) 
          to better estimate the ionization losses.
         Computation of new fits of experimental data (TOTEM collaboration) 
          to better extrapolate the proton-proton elastic and total cross 
          sections.
         Updating of the proton-proton single diffractive cross section 
          considering a recent parametrization based on the renormalized 
          pomeron flux exchange.
         Updating of the proton-nucleus inelastic and total cross sections 
          considering the new available data from the Particle Data Group.
    -- Further modification to the computation of ionisation losses taking 
       into account the tale of the Landau distribution, since Bethe-Bloch 
       is not valid for beta.gamma>1000 (D. Mirarchi).
   McIntosh/Adriana, 30th April, 2014

    -- Proper stop for single elements with names longer then 16
       characters which may happen for SixTrack input file fort.2 
       produced by MAD-X (could be 24). Before, the 17th column was 
       checked for non-blank character which is a special case only.
       It is checked for 16 non-blank characters, leading blanks allowed.
       Moreover, the code is stopped in case the length of 80 
       characters is exceeded without minimal input, i.e. a mininum
       of 8 characters is needed for valid input.

  SixTrack Version: 4.2.4 Revision 1.31/1.32 adriana
    C. Bracco / A. Rossi / Th. Weiler
    Changes in the collimation part:
    -- Added and updated alignment errors (tilt, offset,
       gap-size): all values of alignment errors can be kept
       identical for different runs, by applying the same seed.
       Therefore the random function myran_gauss and rndm5 have
       been added and the inputs fort.3 adapted.
    -- Alignment errors are also applied for deformed jaws.
    -- Added to the pencil beam section the possibility to
       generate different particle distributions (Gaussian and
       rectangular in x and y) on the selected collimator.
    -- Changes to the do_select option to get the multi-turn
       halo information for all particle packets.

  SixTrack Version: 4.2.2 Revision 1.29 yipeng
    -- First attempt at thin solenoid (work done by Yipeng Sun)

    -- make_six copies only necessary .ast and .f files
       Sorted .f files for crlibm for windows and makes a
       link from the new executable to SixTrack
    -- SixTrack for BNL only, use fort.54 for beambeamdist.dat for

       Modified crpoint,crcheck, and crstart and the size of the C/R file.
    -- If bnlelens, use napx rather napx00/npart for number of pairs
    -- Most important is that bnlens option is now an addition to the
       normal tracking so that the SAME executable can be used for
       normal DA and bnlelens LHC=9 runs (important for BOINC/CPSS)
       but LHC=9 does NOT write binary files nor post-process.
  McIntosh 20th August, 2008

  SixTrack Version: 4.1.7 CVS Version 1.17 McIntosh
    -- make_six has a new 'debug' option to aid SixTrack development.
    -- If debug is selected, a new flag to ASTUTE SixTrack makes 
       available Unit 99 for messages and dumps and a set of dump 
       routines (of which only a full dump in this version).
    -- A  couple of write(* in SUBRE are now handled by C/R.
    -- A couple of bugs with C/R and IDFOR have been fixed.
    -- All subsequent changes noted here are for the 'bnlelens'
       and other SixTrack functionality should be unchanged
       (except that fort.95 and 96 are used for Checkpoint/Restart,
       C/R, instead of 12 and 13.)
    -- The bnlelens option has been implemented in comdecks bnlin and
       bnlout principally so it works for all six tracking routines.
       This has been tested only for THCK6D so far.
       There are now no changes to trauthck and trauthin.
    -- The C/R option for 6d and thick lens is disabled unless
       debug is selected.
    -- C/R now handles additional variables and correctly positions
       the beambeam-output.dat and beambeam-lostID.dat files.
    -- The binary files 90-59 are not used; no post-processing is
       performed. All OPEN/CLOSE have been moved to the standard comdecks
       and the variables moved to COMMON initialised by COMNUL.
    -- The READDIS routine for bnlelens is renamed to BNLRDIS to
       avoid confusion with collimation and it uses UNIT 54 to 
       read beambeamdist.dat which may now have only one sample.
    -- The n_cut and n_nocut variables are set to zero before the j loop.
  McIntosh 18th August, 2008

  SixTrack Version: 4.1.6 CVS Version 1.16 McIntosh
     -- and of course I forgot the SixTrack Version....
     -- Version and moddate set to 4.1.6, I am

     -- The Makefile creates a map and uses -g in FC for NAG.
     -- crlibm is cleaned up for Linux/Windows and logsix.dat and logsix.h are used
        instead of log.c and log.h and inlining is handled with an IFDEF.
     -- In bnlelens Unit 97 (not 98) is used for checkdist.dat.
     -- A problem with open(10... and open(99 is fixed for NAG.

   make_six collimat (does the same but with collimation)
   Supported compilers are lf95 (default) or NAG f95 or g77.
   Fixed a bug with crbinrecs in writebin in sixtrack.s

  SixTrack Version: 4.0.0
   Comments: Includes beam collimation, checkpoint/restart, and
             crlib options along with major code cleanup.

   Options: The following sub-directories, 
            ast_crcrlib ast_crlib ast_straight ast_tilt,
            contain the .ast files for building as follows:
            The straight/tilt builds without/with tilt.
            The crcrlib builds tilt with checkpoint/restart and crlib.
            The crlib builds tilt with crlib.
  
   Default: The .ast files in the current directory are for ast_crlib
            on SLC3 Linux at CERN. The crlibm routines in CRLIBOBJS.a
            are for Linux and have been compiled with lf95 6.2 and gcc 3.2.3.

   The following options are available (after copying the desired ast files
   to the current directory if non-default):

   makex clean

   makex sixtrack_vector_new

   makex sixtrack_da_new
