How to compile
==============

In a machine with CppUTest correctly configured, it can be compiled and tested running "make".

In a machine without CppUTest both 32 and 64 bit versions of the libraries can be compiled issuing the following commands:

make libs BUILD32=Y
make clean
make libs BUILD64=Y

The resulting libraries will be compiled under the directory "lib".

Documentation
=============

The doxygen documentation can be generated with the command "make doc"

Compiling samples
=================

Run "make samples" to compile sample clients and servers under samples directory.
