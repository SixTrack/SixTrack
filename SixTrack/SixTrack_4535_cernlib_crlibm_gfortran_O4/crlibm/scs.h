/** @struct scs 
The SCS data type. 

An SCS number is a a floating-point number in base 2^32.

- Its mantissa is formed of SCS_NB_WORDS digits (currently 32 bits by default)

- Its exponent is a 32-bit integer

- It also has a sign field, and an exception field used to store and
  propagate IEEE-754 exceptions.


The real number represented by a scs structure is equal to:
@f$
\displaystyle 
\sum_{i=0}^{\mathtt{SCS\_NB\_WORDS}} 
2^{(\mathtt{index} -i)\mathtt{SCS\_NB\_BITS}}
\times
\mathtt{h\_word}[i] 
@f$
